# Django Template for OpenShift

## Template App Information
Product: Django  
Version: 1.4  
Source:  https://github.com/django/django.git  
Commit:  2591fb8d4c0246f68b79554976c012039df75359

## Maintenance
This folder contains a diff file that includes the changes made to the
stock Django app in order to make it OpenShift-Template-ready. If
you are a maintainer tasked with updating the Django template, you
may be able to use this patch file on the updated Django code to
automatically reapply these changes.

Here are the steps involved:

1. Under the 'wsgi' directory, apply any patches required to update the 'openshift' Django app.
2. From the template root directory, run 'git apply --check .openshift/template.patch' to test for patching problems.
3. Next run 'git am --signoff < .openshift/template.patch' to apply the patch to the template.

If this process succeeds, then the changes have been automatically
applied. Otherwise it may be necessary to manually apply the
changes. If the base package has changed enough, you may need to
re-audit the base code and generate a new patch file.

Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Repo layout
===========
wsgi/ - Externally exposed wsgi code goes
wsgi/static/ - Public static content gets served here
libs/ - Additional libraries
data/ - For not-externally exposed wsgi code
setup.py - Standard setup.py, specify deps here
../data - For persistent data (also env var: OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR)
.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build - Script that gets run every git push before the build
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']  - Application name
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR']  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR']   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

When embedding a database using 'rhc cartridge add', you can reference environment
variables for username, host and password:

If you embed MySQL, then:

    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST']      - DB host
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT']      - DB Port
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME']  - DB Username
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD']  - DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave wsgi, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


Notes about setup.py
====================

Adding deps to the install_requires will have the OpenShift server actually
install those deps at git push time.

Django on OpenShift
===================

This git repository helps you get up and running quickly w/ a Django
installation on OpenShift.  The Django project name used in this repo
is 'openshift' but you can feel free to change it.  Right now the
backend is sqlite3 and the database runtime is found in
`$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/sqlite3.db`.

Before you push this app for the first time, you will need to change
the [Django admin password](#admin-user-name-and-password).
Then, when you first push this
application to the cloud instance, the sqlite database is copied from
`wsgi/openshift/sqlite3.db` with your newly changed login
credentials. Other than the password change, this is the stock
database that is created when `python manage.py syncdb` is run with
only the admin app installed.

On subsequent pushes, a `python manage.py syncdb` is executed to make
sure that any models you added are created in the DB.  If you do
anything that requires an alter table, you could add the alter
statements in `GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/alter.sql` and then use
`GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy` to execute that script (make
sure to back up your database w/ `rhc app snapshot save` first :) )

You can also turn on the DEBUG mode for Django application using the
`rhc env set DEBUG=True --app APP_NAME`. If you do this, you'll get
nicely formatted error pages in browser for HTTP 500 errors.

Do not forget to turn this environment variable off and fully restart
the application when you finish:

```
$ rhc env unset DEBUG
$ rhc app stop && rhc app start
```

Running on OpenShift
--------------------

Create an account at https://www.openshift.com

Install the RHC client tools if you have not already done so:
    
    sudo gem install rhc
    rhc setup

Create a python application

    rhc app create django python-2.6

Add this upstream repo

    cd django
    git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift/django-example.git
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master

Then push the repo upstream

    git push

Here, the [admin user name and password will be displayed](#admin-user-name-and-password), so pay
special attention.
	
That's it. You can now checkout your application at:

    http://django-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com

Admin user name and password
----------------------------
As the `git push` output scrolls by, keep an eye out for a
line of output that starts with `Django application credentials: `. This line
contains the generated admin password that you will need to begin
administering your Django app. This is the only time the password
will be displayed, so be sure to save it somewhere. You might want 
to pipe the output of the git push to a text file so you can grep for
the password later.


Public, static content goes here.  Users can create rewrite rules to link to
content in the static dir.  For example, django commonly uses /media/
directories for static content.  For example in a .htaccess file in a
wsgi/.htaccess location, developers could put:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^application/media/(.+)$ /static/media/$1 [L]

Then copy the media/* content to yourapp/wsgi/static/media/ and it should
just work.

Note: The ^application/ part of the URI match is required.
