Monospace is a social network for developers. It's our sample Django application, showing how to use Stripe to charge subscribers.

Monospace uses the Stripe Javascript bindings to validate a credit card, and the Stripe Python bindings to create a customer and add the credit card to that customer. Customers can also update their credit card.

Installation steps:
* You will need a publishable token and a secret token. Add them both to monospace/setting.py
