Delicious Cake
==============

Delicious Cake is a flexible, Tastypie derived, REST framework for
Django.

Over the years I've used both Tastypie and Piston to create RESTful
APIs. While they both have their advantages neither is as flexible as
plain old Django views.

Why Delicious Cake?
-------------------

Delicious Cake is a framework that removes much of the pain of creating
RESTful APIs, without imposing many constraints.

How is this different from Tastypie?
------------------------------------

Tastypie makes taking your models and quickly exposing them in a RESTful
manner extremely easy. Unfortunately, that's not often the best way to
expose an api. Some functionality is simply difficult to express within
Tastypie's constraints.

Tastypie resources tightly couple several features: List views, detail
views, data hydration/dehydration, url construction, and
pre-serialization processing of objects. For simple APIs this can reduce
the amount of code necessary to get your project off the ground. As your
project evolves it can become increasingly difficult to express your
ideal API with Tastypie.

Delicious Cake is an attempt to take the best of Tastypie and present it
in a more flexible form.

This is an experiment
---------------------

I want to get this out quickly to see if there is any interest in this
model of API development.

Both tests and documentation are sparse. If there's enough interest,
test coverage and documentation will become a priority.
