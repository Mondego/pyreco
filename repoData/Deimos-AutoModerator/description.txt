# Introduction
This is a bot for [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), meant to automate straightforward moderation tasks by automatically performing actions based on defined conditions.

If you'd like to utilize this functionality without running your own instance, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator/wiki/Initial-wiki-setup

## Disclaimer

This code has been made public largely for the purpose of displaying exactly what AutoModerator does, and as an example for others working on reddit bots (moderation-related or otherwise). It may be difficult for others to get functional. Use at your own risk.
