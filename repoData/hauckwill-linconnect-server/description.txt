=================

Mirror Android notifications on a Linux desktop.

LinConnect Client: https://github.com/hauckwill/linconnect-client/

Introduction
------------
LinConnect is a project to mirror *all* Android notifications on a Linux desktop using LibNotify.

*Please note that this is my first time using Python (though I do have experience in other languages), so the code may still be messy. It's a WIP.*

Installation
------------

**Requirements**

* python2
* python-pip
* python-gobject
* libavahi-compat-libdnssd1
* cherrypy (python package)
* pybonjour (python package)

**Running**

Simply run linconnect_server.py to start the server, then start the Android application. The Android application will detect the server and display it in the server list. Selecting it will send a test notification to the server.

**Simple Setup (tested on Ubuntu 13.10)**

Enter the following command into a console to install the server, set it to autostart, and run LinConnect. The server will be automatically updated daily.

```bash
$ wget --quiet https://raw.github.com/hauckwill/linconnect-server/master/LinConnectServer/install.sh; \
chmod +x install.sh; \
./install.sh
```

To remove LinConnect, delete the ~/.linconnect directory.
