About
=====

Aurora is a web interface for `Fabric <http://fabfile.org/>`_ (Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks).

It aims to help people who can't use Fabric from console. Also, it allows to manage rights between them and to keep history of deployments.
