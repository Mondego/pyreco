# Contributing to sqlmap

## Reporting bugs

**Bug reports are welcome**!
Please report all bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/issues) or, alternatively, to the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sqlmap-users).

### Guidelines

* Before you submit a bug report, search both open and closed issues to make sure the issue has not come up before. Also, check the [user's manual](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki) for anything relevant.
* Make sure you can reproduce the bug with the latest development version of sqlmap.
* Your report should give detailed instructions for how to reproduce the problem. If sqlmap raises an unhandled exception, the traceback is needed. Details of the unexpected behaviour are welcome too. A small test case (just a few lines) is ideal.
* If you are making an enhancement request, lay out the rationale for the feature you are requesting. *Why would this feature be useful?*
* If you are not sure whether something is a bug, or want to discuss a potential new feature before putting in an enhancement request, the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sqlmap-users) is a good place to bring it up.

## Submitting code changes

All code contributions are greatly appreciated. First off, clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap), read the [user's manual](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki) carefully, go through the code yourself and [drop us an email](mailto:dev@sqlmap.org) if you are having a hard time grasping its structure and meaning. We apologize for not commenting the code enough - you could take a chance to read it through and [improve it](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/issues/37).

Our preferred method of patch submission is via a Git [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
Many [people](https://raw.github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/master/doc/THANKS.md) have contributed in different ways to the sqlmap development. **You** can be the next!

### Guidelines

In order to maintain consistency and readability throughout the code, we ask that you adhere to the following instructions:

* Each patch should make one logical change.
* Wrap code to 76 columns when possible.
* Avoid tabbing, use four blank spaces instead.
* Before you put time into a non-trivial patch, it is worth discussing it on the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sqlmap-users) or privately by [email](mailto:dev@sqlmap.org).
* Do not change style on numerous files in one single pull request, we can [discuss](mailto:dev@sqlmap.org) about those before doing any major restyling, but be sure that personal preferences not having a strong support in [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) will likely to be rejected.
* Make changes on less than five files per single pull request - there is rarely a good reason to have more than five files changed on one pull request, as this dramatically increases the review time required to land (commit) any of those pull requests.
* Style that is too different from main branch will be ''adapted'' by the developers side.
* Do not touch anything inside `thirdparty/` and `extra/` folders.

### Licensing

By submitting code contributions to the sqlmap developers, to the mailing list, or via Git pull request, checking them into the sqlmap source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) that you are offering the sqlmap copyright holders the unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code. This is important because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other software projects (such as KDE and NASM). If you wish to specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you send them.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

To use cloak.py you need to pass it the original file,
and optionally the output file name.

Example:

$ python ./cloak.py -i backdoor.asp -o backdoor.asp_

This will create an encrypted and compressed binary file backdoor.asp_.

Such file can then be converted to its original form by using the -d
functionality of the cloak.py program:

$ python ./cloak.py -d -i backdoor.asp_ -o backdoor.asp

If you skip the output file name, general rule is that the compressed
file names are suffixed with the character '_', while the original is
get by skipping the last character. So, that means that the upper
examples can also be written in the following form:

$ python ./cloak.py -i backdoor.asp

$ python ./cloak.py -d -i backdoor.asp_

To use dbgtool.py you need to pass it the MS-DOS executable binary file,
and optionally the output debug.exe script file name.

Example:

$ python ./dbgtool.py -i ./nc.exe -o nc.scr

This will create a ASCII text file with CRLF line terminators called
nc.scr.

Such file can then be converted to its original portable executable with
the Windows native debug.exe, that is installed by default in all Windows
systems:

icmpsh - simple reverse ICMP shell

icmpsh is a simple reverse ICMP shell with a win32 slave and a POSIX compatible master in C or Perl.


--- Running the Master ---

The master is straight forward to use. There are no extra libraries required for the C version. 
The Perl master however has the following dependencies:

    * IO::Socket
    * NetPacket::IP
    * NetPacket::ICMP


When running the master, don't forget to disable ICMP replies by the OS. For example:

    sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1

If you miss doing that, you will receive information from the slave, but the slave is unlikely to receive
commands send from the master.


--- Running the Slave ---

The slave comes with a few command line options as outlined below:


-t host            host ip address to send ping requests to. This option is mandatory!

-r                 send a single test icmp request containing the string "Test1234" and then quit. 
                   This is for testing the connection.

-d milliseconds    delay between requests in milliseconds 

-o milliseconds    timeout of responses in milliseconds. If a response has not received in time, 
                   the slave will increase a counter of blanks. If that counter reaches a limit, the slave will quit.
                   The counter is set back to 0 if a response was received.

-b num             limit of blanks (unanswered icmp requests before quitting

-s bytes           maximal data buffer size in bytes


In order to improve the speed, lower the delay (-d) between requests or increase the size (-s) of the data buffer.

be used for running command prompt commands skipping standard "cmd /c" way. 
They are licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Compile only the Release version because the Runtime library option
(Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code
Generation) is set to "Multi-threaded (/MT)", which statically links
everything into executable and doesn't compile Debug version at all.

To use safe2bin.py you need to pass it the original file,
and optionally the output file name.

Example:

$ python ./safe2bin.py -i output.txt -o output.txt.bin

This will create an binary decoded file output.txt.bin. For example, 
if the content of output.txt is: "\ttest\t\x32\x33\x34\nnewline" it will 
be decoded to: "	test	234
newline"

If you skip the output file name, general rule is that the binary
file names are suffixed with the string '.bin'. So, that means that 
the upper example can also be written in the following form:

$ python ./safe2bin.py -i output.txt

sqlmap
==

sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

Due to the anti-virus positive detection of shell scripts stored inside
this folder, we needed to somehow circumvent this. As from the plain
sqlmap users perspective nothing has to be done prior to their usage by
sqlmap, but if you want to have access to their original source code use
the decrypt functionality of the ../extra/cloak/cloak.py utility.

To prepare the original scripts to the cloaked form use this command:
find backdoor.* stager.* -type f -exec python ../extra/cloak/cloak.py -i '{}' \;

To get back them into the original form use this:
find backdoor.*_ stager.*_ -type f -exec python ../extra/cloak/cloak.py -d -i '{}' \;
