# Sublime Ensime

This project provides an integration with ensime and Sublime Text Editor 2.
Sublime as an outstanding API so it should be possible to get all of ensime's features in Sublime Text Editor 2.

## What's working?
The plugin is able to communicate with an ensime server and it should also be able to do reformat source. 
For some reason it seems that the java server doesn't get killed when you close the sublime application.
There is NO support yet for the subprojects in an .ensime file.

  * Reformat source
  * Organize imports
  * highlighting syntax errors, shows message in status bar
  * Type inspection, needs a delay and cancellable queue currently accessible via context menu
  

## How to install?

1. Install the package itself:

    a. If you use [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), 
    add repository https://github.com/michaelpnash/sublime-ensime and install package sublime-ensime.
    
    b. Otherwise, in your Sublime Text `Packages` dir (you can find it by `Preferences -> Browse Packages`),

    ```
    git clone git://github.com/michaelpnash/sublime-ensime.git sublime-ensime
    ```
    
2. Install Ensime.

    a. In Unix (including Mac OS X), `cd` into the just created `sublime-ensime` directory and run
    ```
    ./install-ensime-server
    ```

    b. In Windows, just download the version of Ensime listed in the `./install-ensime-server` file
    from https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime/downloads. It will contain a directory with the same 
    name as Ensime version. Extract it into the just created `sublime-ensime` directory and rename
    to `server`.

3. (Re)start Sublime Text editor.

Once you're in a project that has a .ensime file in the root folder, you can start a server from the file context menu. Or run:

```python
window.run_command("ensime_server", { "start": True})
```

## What's planned?
To implement all the features of ensime.

## Wishlist?
I'd like to use the information we get back from ensime to provide semantic highlighting.
