Updated with some details that came up during implementation of the upconverter
parser for gEDA by elbaschid, December 2011

## Overview ##

This file is the official documentation for the file formats in gEDA/gaf
(gschem And Friends). The primary file format used in gEDA/gaf is the
schematic/symbol format. Files which end with .sch or .sym are schematics
or symbol files. Until there is another file type in gEDA/gaf, then this
document will only cover the symbol/schematic file format.
This file format document is current as of gEDA/gaf version 20040111.
This document covers file format version 1 and 2.
Note, this file format and any other file formats associated with gEDA
are placed under the General Public License (GPL) version 2.0. The
gEDA/gaf symbol and schematic file format is Copyright (C) 1998-2004

## Coordinate Space ##

All coordinates are in mils (1/1000 of an inch). This is an arbitrary decision. 
Remember in there is no concept of physical lengths/dimensions in schematics and 
symbols (for schematic capture only).

 * Origin is in lower left hand corner. 
 * The size of the coordinate space is unlimited, but it is recommended that all objects stay within (120.0, 90.0) (x, y inches).
 * It is generally advisable to have positive x and y coordinates, however, negative coordinates work too, but not recommended.
 * A grid segment is of 100 x 100 mils size.
 * The blueprint frame of a schematic is usually not in the origin but translated to (40000, 4000) in mils.

The following figure shows how the coordinate space is setup: 
TODO: insert image

X axis increases going to the right. Y axis increase going up. Coordinate system is landscape and corresponds to a sheet of paper turned on its side.

## Filenames ##

Symbols end in .sym. The only symbol filename convention that is used in gEDA/gaf is that if there are multiple instances of a symbol with the same name (like a 7400), then a -1, -2, -3, … -N suffix is added to the end of the filename. Example: 7400-1.sym, 7400-2.sym, 7400-3.sym…
Schematics end in .sch. There used to be a schematic filename convention (adding a -1 .. -N to the end of the basename), but this convention is now obsolete. Schematic filenames can be anything that makes sense to the creator.

## Object types ##

A schematic/symbol file for gEDA/gaf consists of:

 * A version (v) as the first item in the file. This is required.
 * Any number of objects and the correct data. Objects are specified by an “object type”
 * Most objects are a single line, however text objects are two lines long.
 * No blank lines at the end of the file (these are ignored by the tools)
 * For all enumerated types in the gEDA/gaf file formats, the field takes on the numeric value.

The “object type” id is a single letter and this id must start in the
first column. The object type id is case sensitive. The schematic and
symbol files share the same file layout. A symbol is nothing more than
a collection of primitive objects (lines, boxes, circles, arcs, text,
and pins). A schematic is a collection of symbols (components), nets,
and buses.
The following sections describe the specifics of each recognized object
type. Each section has the name of the object, which file type (sch/sym)
the object can appear in, the format of the data, a description of each
individual field, details and caveats of the fields, and finally an
example with description.
For information on the color index (which is used in practically all
objects), see the Color section.

 * The type is a lower case “v” (as in Victor).
 * This object must be in every file used or created by the gEDA/gaf tools.
 * The format of the first version field is YYYYMMDD.
 * The version number is not an arbitrary timestamp. Do not make up a version number and expect the tools to behave properly.
 * The “version of gEDA/gaf that wrote this file” was used in all versions of gEDA/gaf up to 20030921 as the file formats version. This field should no longer be used to determine the file format. It is used for information purposes only now.
 * Starting at and after gEDA/gaf version 20031004, the fileformat version field is used to determine the file format version. All file format code should key off of this field.
 * fileformat version increases when the file format changes.
 * The starting point for fileformat version was 1. The current fileformat is 2.
 * fileformat version is just an integer with no minor number.
 * Development versions include: 19990601, 19990610, 19990705, 19990829, 19990919, 19991011, 20000220, 20000704, 20001006, 20001217, 20010304, 20010708, 20010722, 20020209, 20020414, 20020527, 20020825, 20021103, 20030223, 20030525, 20030901, 20040111, 20040710, 20041228, 20050313, 20050820, 20060123, 20060824, 20060906, 20061020, 20070216, 20070705, 20070708, 20070818, 20071229, 20080110, 20080127, 20080706, 20081220, 20081221, 20090328, 20090829, 20090830, 20110116, 20110619

 * This object is a picture object. The first line contains all the picture parameters, and the second line is the path and filename of the picture. The filename is not used if the picture is embedded.
 * The angle of the picture can only take on one of the following values: 0, 90, 180, 270.
 * The mirrored field is an enumerated type:
  * NOT MIRRORED = 0
  * MIRRORED = 1
 * The embedded field is an enumerated type:
  * NOT EMBEDDED = 0
  * EMBEDDED = 1 (not yet supported)
 * The encoded picture and encoded picture end fields are only in the file if the picture is embedded in the schematic:
  * encoded picture data: This is a multiple line field. The picture is serialized and then encoded using base64. This way the encoded data uses only printable characters. This field is the result of these two operations.
  * encoded picture end : A line containing only a single dot '.' character marks the end of the encoded picture data.

Example:
<pre>
G 16900 35800 1400 2175 0 0 0
../bitmaps/logo.jpg
</pre>

A picture object with the lower left corner at (16900, 35800). The width of the image is 1400 mils, and its height is 2175 mils. The picture rotation is 0 degrees and the picture is not mirrored, neither embedded.
The picture path and filename is showed in the second line.

Example:
<pre>
G 16900 35800 1400 2175 0 0 1
../bitmaps/logo.jpg
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
.
</pre>

A picture object with the lower left corner at (16900, 35800). The width of the image is 1400 mils, and its height is 2175 mils.
The picture rotation is 0 degrees, it is not mirrored, and it is embedded.
The picture path and filename is showed in the second line. Since this is an embedded picture, the filename and path are not used.
The encoded picture data is only an example (it is not real data). The last line containing a single dot '.' character marks the end of the encoded picture data.

### text and attributes ###

Depending on context, text objects can play different roles. Outside any
environment, they represent informative lines of text. When enclosed by
curly braces, they are interpreted as attributes. See the attributes
section.

 * This object is a multi line object. The first line contains all the text parameters and the subsequent lines are the text strings.
 * There must be exactly num lines of text following the T … string.
 * The maximum length of any single text string is 1024, however there is no limit to the number of text string lines.
 * The minimum size is 2 points (1/72 of an inch).
 * There is no maximum size.
 * The coordinate pair is the origin of the text item.
 * The visibility field is an enumerated type:
  * INVISIBLE = 0
  * VISIBLE = 1
 * The show_name_value is an enumerated type:
  * SHOW NAME VALUE = 0 (show both name and value of an attribute)
  * SHOW VALUE = 1 (show only the value of an attribute)
  * SHOW NAME = 2 (show only the name of an attribute)
 * The show_name_value field is only valid if the string is an attribute (string has to be in the form: name=value to be considered an attribute).
 * The angle of the text can only take on one of the following values: 0, 90, 180, 270. A value of 270 will always generate upright text.
 * The alignment/origin field controls the relative location of the origin.
 * The alignment field can take a value from 0 to 8.
 * The following diagram shows what the values for the alignment field mean:
  * TODO: fileformat_textgraphic.jpg
 * The num_lines field always starts at 1.
 * The num_lines field was added starting with file format version 1. Past versions (0 or earlier) only supported single line text objects.
 * The text strings of the string line(s) can have overbars if the text is embedded in two overbar markers “\_”. A single backslash needs to be written as “\\”.

Example 1:
<pre>
T 16900 35800 3 10 1 0 0 0 1
Text string!
</pre>

A text object with the origin at (16900, 35800), color index 3, 10
points in size, visible, attribute flags not valid (not an attribute),
origin at lower left, not rotated, string: Text string!

Example 2:
<pre>
T 16900 35800 3 10 1 0 0 0 5
Text string line 1
Text string line 2
Text string line 3
Text string line 4
Text string line 5

This is a similar text object as the above example, however here there
are five lines of text.

Example 3:
<pre>
T 10000 20000 3 10 1 1 8 90 1
pinlabel=R/\_W\_
</pre>

A text object with the origin at (10000, 20000), color index 3, 10
points in size, visible, only the value of the attribute is visible,
text origin at upper right, the text is rotated by 90 degree, the
string: “R/W” has an overbar over the “W”.

## Colors ##

In the gEDA/gaf schematic and symbol file format colors are specified
via an integer index. The relationship between integer and color is
based on object type. Each object type typically has one or more colors.
Here is a table of color index to object type:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Index</th>
		<th>Object type</th>

</table>

The actual color associated with the color index is defined on a per
tool bases. Objects are typically assigned their corresponding color
index, but it is permissible (sometimes) to assign other color index
values to different object types. 

## Attributes ###

Attributes are enclosed in braces {} and can only be text. Attributes
are text items which take on the form name=value. If it doesn't have
name=value, it's not an attribute. Attributes are attached to the
previous object. Here's an example:
<pre>
P 988 500 1300 500 1
{
T 1000 570 5 8 1 1 0
pinseq=3
T 1000 550 5 8 1 1 0
pinnumber=3
}
</pre>
The object is a pin which has an attribute pinnumber=3 and pinseq=3
(name=value). You can have multiple text objects (both the T … and text
string are required) in between the braces {}. As of 20021103, you can
only attached text items as attributes. Attaching other object types as
attributes is unsupported.
You can also have “toplevel” attributes. These attributes are not
attached to any object, but instead are just text objects that take on
the form name=value.
These attributes are useful when you need to convey some info about a
schematic page or symbol and need the netlister to have access to this
info.


## Embedded Components

Embedded components are components which have all of their definition
stored within the schematic file. When a users place a component onto a
schematic page, they have the option of making the component embedded.
Other than storing all the symbol information inside of the schematic,
an embedded component is just any other component. Embedded components
are defined as:
<pre>
C 18600 21500 1 0 0 EMBEDDD555-1.sym
[
...
... Embedded primitive objects
...
]
</pre>
In the example above, **555-1.sym** is the component. The EMBEDDED tag and
the [ ] are the distinguishing characteristics of embedded components.
**componentname.sym** must exist in one of the specified component-libraries
if you want to unembed the component.

## Path data ##

The gEDA/gaf path data format has been deliberately specified to match
a subset of that in the W3C SVG standard..

 * As an implementation detail; libgeda takes code from librsvg, an SVG parsing library. As a result, the majority of SVG path syntax is read correctly, however this is always normalised to absolute move, line, Bézier curve and close-path commands internally (and is saved as such).
 * Coordinates along the path are specified in the standard gschem coordinate space.
 * Those path commands which gEDA emits, and will guarantee to parse, are listed in the table below:
(Text taken from the above SVG specification). 
 * In the table below, the following notation is used:
  * (): grouping of parameters
  * +: 1 or more of the given parameter(s) is required

M 100,100 L 500,100 C 700,100 800,275 800,400
C 800,525 700,700 500,700 L 100,700 z
</pre>

And a complete schematic:

<pre>
v 20080706 1
H 3 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 2 20 100 -1 -1 6
M 100,100
L 500,100
C 700,100 800,275 800,400
C 800,525 700,700 500,700
L 100,700
z
</pre>
The resulting path (with control points drawn on to illustrate their positions) is shown here:

ViewDraw (and descendents) Schematic Parser
==========================================
As best I (Patrick Yeon) can tell, ViewDraw has been associated with ViewLogic, Innoveda Corp., and now with Mentor under their ePD and DxDesigner tools. The format, extended as needed, still shows up in some places in the latest version of DxDesigner I have seen, even though the iCDB is meant to be the project database.

The work to understand the format is based off Stuart Brorson and Steven Salkow's earlier "ViewDraw File Formats" documentation, with Patrick Yeon working out further extended details based on ViewDraw output files strewn about online.

Current Status
--------------
The parser can make a decent attempt at parsing schematic and symbol data from old versions (schematic files with V 51, symbol files with V 50 or 51, that I've seen). It has no way to stitch together multi-page designs, and some details fall through the cracks because they haven't been worked into the upverter format (yet).

This parser has been developed with the [ml50x design files](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/ml50x_schematics.zip)

Bugs, Omissions, and other Brokeness
------------------------------------
At the moment, probably a fair number.
* A few features of the ViewDraw format couldn't be fit into the upverter output format yet: part flipping and re-scaling, at least

Todo
----
In no particular order:
* Harden up against invalid input
* Work is likely required around pin numbering/naming
* Nets should be streamlined so that they use a minimum of points
* Test, test, test.

How To Help
-----------
I no longer have access to DxDesigner, so any design output to help shore up the understanding of this format would be helpful, especially if it is not currently handled properly or completely by the code. ViewDraw output from other tools/versions would also be helpful.

Further Notes
-------------
From a helpful viewdraw.ini, suspect this is about the `Q` command:

Supported Formats
---------------

  The converter can import and export in the following popular open and closed source formats.

* Upverter OpenJSON
* KiCad
* gEDA
* Fritzing
* RS274-X Gerber (see note)
* NC Drill
* Eagle
* Eagle XML             (in testing)
* ViewDraw / DxDesigner (in testing)
* DSN                   (in testing)
* PNG Image
* Bill of Materials
* CSV Netlist
* Altium                (in development)
* Telesis Netlist       (in development)

Gerber Export Note:
Gerber export requires the arial.ttf font in the working directory the converter is run from.

Format Wish List
---------------

  This is the list of formats we wish we supported, and will work on or finish someday soon. We are looking for developers to help us so please ping us if you're interested!

* OrCad
* Existing supported formats - layout data
* DipTrace


The Concept
---------------

  To use an Upverter Open JSON export in another piece of software, you will need to convert it into that software's proprietary format. Likewise, to get your data out of another piece of software and import it into Upverter, you will also need to run their export through the converter. We are working to make this easier, but we will largely depend on community contribution and the participation of the other vendors.


Interchange Format Documentation
---------------

  The converter is based on the Upverter Open JSON Format fully documented at http://support.upverter.com/customer/portal/articles/553504-documentation-for-open-json-format. We hope that someday all of the major providers of schematic capture software will support interoperability with open formats like this one.


Key Contributors
---------------

  The converter has been an ongoing project since mid-2011 made up of many, many contributions by a team of distributed developers associated by little more than our desire to fix what we see as the horribly broken world of ECAD interoperability. The key contributors are as follows:

* jdavisp3    -  KiCad, Fritzing, EagleXML, Stability
* elbaschid   -  gEDA
* iparshin    -  EagleBin
* foobarmus   -  Gerber
* patrickyeon -  ViewDraw, Image
* machinaut   -  OpenJSON, Architecture
