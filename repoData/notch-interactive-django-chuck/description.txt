Edit CSS Style plug-in notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike WYSIWYG editor functionality that operates only on the selected text,
typically by inserting new HTML elements with the specified styles.
This plug-in operates on the HTML blocks surrounding the selected text.
No new HTML elements are created.

This plug-in only operates on the surrounding blocks and not the nearest
parent node.  This means that if a block encapsulates a node,
e.g <p><span>text</span></p>, then only the styles in the block are
recognized, not those in the span.

When selecting text that includes multiple blocks at the same level (peers),
this plug-in accumulates the specified styles in all of the surrounding blocks
and populates the dialogue checkboxes accordingly.  There is no differentiation
between styles set in all the blocks versus styles set in some of the blocks.

When the [Update] or [Apply] buttons are pressed, the styles selected in the
checkboxes are applied to all blocks that surround the selected text.

Django Chuck - Your powerful project punch button
=================================================

About
-----

Django Chuck is a modular, open source, command-based project build system
developed by Notch Interactive GmbH, that gives you the power to create
new projects as fast as pushing on a button.

In the Django Chuck world, everything is organized within so-called modules, which
incrementally get compiled into a project. There is really nothing that you can't
configure or adjust and guess what, writing and adjusting your modules is totally easy.
On top of that, Django Chuck comes with an already impressive amount of built-in
modules and a bullet proof project structure.

But Chuck cannot be just used to create a project. It can also checkout the
source for you and setup everything until the dev server is up and running and
you're ready to do your development work. Just leave all the annoying stuff
to Chuck and if there is some task Chuck can't do for you at the moment you
can add your own command to let Chuck configure your continuous integration
system, setup your hosting or do whatever you might imagine!

.. warning::
   Please note, that currently Django Chuck does NOT work on Windows machines. Please note
   further, that even though there are bindings to almost all important VC systems, only
   Git has been thoroughly tested.
