Introduction
------------

The desktop package provides desktop environment detection and resource
opening support for a selection of common and standardised desktop
environments.

Currently, in Python's standard library, there is apparently no coherent,
cross-platform way of getting the user's environment to "open" files or
resources (showing such files in browsers or editors, for example) when
requested by a Python program. There is an os.startfile function which works
for Windows, but no equivalent function for other desktop environments - the
webbrowser module seems to employ alternative mechanisms in choosing and
running external programs and presumably does not seek to provide general
support for non-URL resources anyway.  

Since desktop environments like KDE and GNOME provide mechanisms for running
browsers and editors according to the identified type of a file or resource,
just as Windows "runs" files or resources, it is appropriate to have a module
which accesses these mechanisms. It is this kind of functionality that the
desktop package aims to support. Note that this approach is arguably better
than that employed by the webbrowser module since most desktop environments
already provide mechanisms for configuring and choosing the user's preferred
programs for various activities, whereas the webbrowser module makes
relatively uninformed guesses (for example, opening Firefox on a KDE desktop
configured to use Konqueror as the default browser).

Some ideas for desktop detection (XFCE) and URL opening (XFCE, X11) were
obtained from the xdg-utils project which seeks to implement programs
performing similar functions to those found in the desktop module. The
xdg-utils project can be found here:

http://portland.freedesktop.org/

Other information regarding desktop icons and menus, screensavers and MIME
configuration can also be found in xdg-utils.

Notes
-----

Notes on desktop application/environment support:

KDE           Supports file and URL opening using kfmclient, where the openURL
              command opens the resource and the exec command runs the
              resource.

KDE 4         Similar to KDE but uses kioclient instead of kfmclient.

GNOME         Supports file and URL opening using gnome-open.

XFCE          Supports file and URL opening using exo-open.

ROX-Filer     Supports file opening using "rox <filename>" but not URL
              opening.

Making Packages
---------------

To make Debian-based packages:

  1. Create new package directories under packages if necessary.
  2. Make a symbolic link in the distribution's root directory to keep the
     Debian tools happy:

     ln -s packages/ubuntu-hoary/python2.4-desktop/debian/
     ln -s packages/ubuntu-feisty/python-desktop/debian/
     ln -s packages/ubuntu-hardy/python-desktop/debian/

  3. Run the package builder:

     dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

  4. Locate and tidy up the packages in the parent directory of the
     distribution's root directory.

Quick-Start
===========

This is for those who want to get up & running quickly.

1. Docutils requires Python (version 2.4 or later), available from

     http://www.python.org/

   See Requirements_ below for details.

2. Use the latest Docutils code.  Get the code from the `Subversion
   repository`_ or from the snapshot:

     http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/trunk/docutils/?view=tar

   See `Releases & Snapshots`_ below for details.

3. Unpack the tarball in a temporary directory (**not** directly in
   Python's ``site-packages``), go to the directory created by expanding
   the archive, and run ``setup.py install`` with admin rights. On
   Windows systems it may be sufficient to double-click ``install.py``.

   See Installation_ below for details.

4. Use the front-end scripts to convert reStructuredText documents.
   Try for example::

       rst2html.py FAQ.txt FAQ.html         (Unix)
       python tools/rst2html.py FAQ.txt FAQ.html  (Windows)

   See Usage_ below for details.


Purpose
=======

The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for
processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
XML, and LaTeX.  Support for the following sources has been
implemented:

* Standalone files.

* `PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_.

Support for the following sources is planned:

* Inline documentation from Python modules and packages, extracted
  with namespace context.

* Email (RFC-822 headers, quoted excerpts, signatures, MIME parts).

* Wikis, with global reference lookups of "wiki links".

* Compound documents, such as multiple chapter files merged into a
  book.

* And others as discovered.

.. _PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals):
   http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0012.html


Releases & Snapshots
====================

While we are trying to follow a "release early & often" policy,
features are added very frequently.  Since the code in the Subversion
repository is usually in a bug-free state, we recommend that you use
the current snapshot (which is usually updated within an hour of
changes being committed to the repository):

* Snapshot of Docutils code, documentation, front-end tools, and
  tests:
  http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/trunk/docutils/?view=tar

* Snapshot of the Sandbox (experimental, contributed code):
  http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/trunk/sandbox/?view=tar

To keep up to date on the latest developments, download fresh copies of
the snapshots regularly or use a working copy of the
`Subversion repository`_.

.. _Subversion repository: docs/dev/repository.html


Requirements
============

To run the code, Python_ must be installed.
Docutils is compatible with Python versions from 2.4 up to 2.7 and
versions 3.1 and 3.2 (cf. `PythonÂ 3 compatibility`_).

Docutils uses the following packages for enhanced functionality, if they are
installed:

* The `Python Imaging Library`_, or PIL, is used for some image
  manipulation operations.

* The `Pygments`_ syntax highlighter is used for content of `code`
  directives and roles.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/.
.. _Python Imaging Library: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
.. _Pygments: http://pygments.org/


PythonÂ 3 compatibility
----------------------

The Docutils codebase is written for PythonÂ 2 and uses "on-demand"
translation for `porting to PythonÂ 3`_.

* The `setup.py` script generates PythonÂ 3 compatible sources in
  ``build/`` and tests in ``tests3/`` sub-directories during
  installation_ with PythonÂ 3.

* The scripts in the ``tools/`` sub-directory work with all supported
  Python versions without conversion.

* To convert the sources without installing (e.g. for testing), run
  ``python3 setup.py build``.

* When editing the source, do changes on the PythonÂ 2 versions of the
  files and re-run the build command.

Using Docutils with PythonÂ 3.x is less tested and might still have some
issues.

* test3: Converted tests.


Installation
============

The first step is to expand the ``.tgz`` archive in a temporary
directory (**not** directly in Python's ``site-packages``).  It
contains a distutils setup file "setup.py".  OS-specific installation
instructions follow.


GNU/Linux, BSDs, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.
-------------------------------------

1. Open a shell.

2. Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

       cd <archive_directory_path>

3. Install the package (you may need root permissions to complete this
   step)::

       su
       (enter admin password)
       python setup.py install

   If the python executable isn't on your path, you'll have to specify
   the complete path, such as ``/usr/local/bin/python``.

   To install for a specific Python version, use this version in the
   setup call, e.g. ::

       python3.1 setup.py install

   To install for different Python versions, repeat stepÂ 3 for every
   required version. The last installed version will be used in the
   `shebang line`_ of the ``rst2*.py`` wrapper scripts.

   .. _shebang line: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29

Windows
-------

Just double-click ``install.py``.  If this doesn't work, try the
following:

1. Open a DOS Box (Command Shell, MS-DOS Prompt, or whatever they're
   calling it these days).

2. Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

       cd <archive_directory_path>

3. Install the package::

       <path_to_python.exe>\python setup.py install

   To install for a specific python version, specify the Python
   executable for this version.

   To install for different Python versions, repeat stepÂ 3 for every
   required version.

Optional steps:

* `running the test suite`_

* `converting the documentation`_


Usage
=====

There are many front-end tools in the unpacked "tools" subdirectory.
Installation under Unix places copies in the PATH.
You may want to begin with the "rst2html.py" front-end tool.  Most
tools take up to two arguments, the source path and destination path,
with STDIN and STDOUT being the defaults.  Use the "--help" option to
the front-end tools for details on options and arguments.  See
Docutils Front-End Tools (``docs/user/tools.txt``) for full documentation.

The package modules are continually growing and evolving.  The
``docutils.statemachine`` module is usable independently.  It contains
extensive inline documentation (in reStructuredText format of course).

Contributions are welcome!


Converting the documentation
============================

After unpacking and installing the Docutils package, the following
shell commands will generate HTML for all included documentation::

    cd <archive_directory_path>/tools
    ./buildhtml.py ../

On Windows systems, type::

    cd <archive_directory_path>\tools
    python buildhtml.py ..

The final directory name of the ``<archive_directory_path>`` is
"docutils" for snapshots.  For official releases, the directory may be
called "docutils-X.Y.Z", where "X.Y.Z" is the release version.
Alternatively::

    cd <archive_directory_path>
    tools/buildhtml.py --config=tools/docutils.conf          (Unix)
    python tools\buildhtml.py --config=tools\docutils.conf   (Windows)

Some files may generate system messages (warnings and errors).  The
``docs/user/rst/demo.txt`` file (under the archive directory) contains
five intentional errors.  (They test the error reporting mechanism!)


Running the Test Suite
======================

The test suite is documented in `Docutils Testing`_ (docs/dev/testing.txt).

To run the entire test suite, open a shell and use the following
commands::

    cd <archive_directory_path>/test
    ./alltests.py

Under Windows, type::

    cd <archive_directory_path>\test
    python alltests.py

For testing with PythonÂ 3 use the converted test suite::

    cd <archive_directory_path>/test3
    python3 alltests.py


You should see a long line of periods, one for each test, and then a
summary like this::

    Ran 1111 tests in 24.653s

    OK
    Elapsed time: 26.189 seconds

The number of tests will grow over time, and the times reported will
depend on the computer running the tests.  The difference between the
two times represents the time required to set up the tests (import
modules, create data structures, etc.).

If any of the tests fail, please `open a bug report`_, `send email`_,
or post a message via the `web interface`_ (see `Bugs <BUGS.html>`_).
Please include all relevant output, information about your operating
system, Python version, and Docutils version.  To see the Docutils
version, use one of the ``rst2*`` front ends or ``tools/quicktest.py``
with the ``--version`` option, e.g.::

    cd ../tools
    ./quicktest.py --version

Windows users type these commands::

    cd ..\tools
    python quicktest.py --version

This is release branch v2.1 of MathJax

# MathJax

## Beautiful math in all browsers

MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and
AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.  It was designed with
the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a
single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers
and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no
plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write
web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be
able to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some
mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.

Some of the main features of MathJax include:

- High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages

- Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special
  setup for the reader

- Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers

- Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other
  advanced functionality

- Powerful API for integration with other web applications

See <http://www.mathjax.org/> for additional details.


## Installation and Usage

The MathJax installation and usage documentation is available in the
`docs/html` directory of the MathJax distribution (see
`docs/html/index.html` for the starting point).  The documents are also
available on the MathJax web site on line at <http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/>.


## Community

The main MathJax website is <http://www.mathjax.org>, and it includes
announcements and other important information.  MathJax is maintained and
distributed on GitHub at <http://github.com/mathjax/MathJax>.  A user forum
for asking questions and getting assistance is hosted at Google, and the
bug tracker is hosted at GitHub:

Bug tracker:         <https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues>  
MathJax-Users Group: <http://groups.google.com/group/mathjax-users>

Before reporting a bug, please check that it has not already been reported.
