## CONFIGURATION
See config.example for an example configuration file to put in ~/.cortex/config,
the following options are available:

### frontpage=http://reddit.com/.json
    Frontpage json url, substitute your personal one here if you want
    cortex to display your own subreddit subscriptions.

### inbox=
    Unread messages json url, put your personal one here if you want
    cortex to display your unread message count.

### sort=-read
    Field to sort the entries by. A "-" in front of the field name
    indicates a reverse sort order.

    Not specifying a sort option will leave the ordering to reddit
    (this usually means you will see the same order in cortex as
    you would on your frontpage).

    Some fields that can be sorted by:
        created: Article creation time
        title: Article title alphabetically
        score: Article total score
        read: Whether the article is marked read or not

### title-format= Cortex -- Reddit/{title}: {total} articles, {new} new
    Format used in the application title bar.
    Note: In python 2.5, use %(VAR)s formatting.

    Available variables:
        {title}: Title of the current subreddit or "Frontpage".
        {total}: Total amount of articles in the listing.
        {new}: Amount of unread articles in the listing.

### entry-format-minimal= {title} %> {subreddit:<13} | {num_comments:4}
### entry-format-full= {title} %n  [{score:4}] {read} {nsfw} %> {domain:30}
###                   {subreddit:<13}   {num_comments:4} comments
    Formats used for entries in the list in minimal and full mode 
    respectively.
    Note: In python 2.5, use %(VAR)s formatting.

        Available variables:
            {title}: Article title.
            {subreddit}: Article subreddit.
            {num_comments}: Amount of comments the article has.
            {score}: Article score
            {ups}: Article total upvotes
            {downs}: Article total downvotes
            {domain}: Article domain
            {author}: Article submitter/author

            {read}: "[New]" if the article is new, empty otherwise.
            {nsfw}: "NSFW" if the article in not safe for work, empty otherwise.

    You can use %> to indicate that the rest of the line should be aligned
    to the right of the screen.

    In the full entry format, you can use one "%n" to indicate the separation
    between the top and bottom lines in the listing.

### seen-size=500
    Amount of articles to save seen/read status for.

### browser-command=
    Command to invoke the webbrowser. The {0} will be replaced by the url
    to open. (Use %s in python 2.5)

    If left empty, cortex will try to autodetect the default browser for
    the system.

### browser-background=1
    Whether the browser command should be backgrounded. Set to 0 to
    wait for the browser to finish before continuing cortex execution.

    This is needed when using console browsers like lynx or w3m so they do
    not get executed in the background.

### update-interval=10
    Amount of minutes between automatic updates/refreshes.

### minimal=0
    Whether to start cortex in minimal mode. Same as pressing 'm'.

## About

[Cortex](http://cortex.glacicle.org/) is a simple application to keep track
and browse through reddit article lists where one would usually need to open
a web browser and possibly use a mouse to navigate.

Since rss readers can get cluttered and are not the same as the actual reddit
homepage, cortex will allow you to stop refreshing the reddit page all the
time while sticking to the same paradigm as the usual reddit frontpage would.

Configuring cortex to display your personal frontpage and monitor your unread
messages is easy, just create a file called ~/.cortex/config, retrieve your
personal reddit json links (Located in Preferences -> RSS feeds) and put
them in the config. It will look something like this:

    [config]
    frontpage=http://www.reddit.com/.json?feed=my-long-personal-hash&user=my-username
    inbox=http://www.reddit.com/message/unread/.json?feed=my-long-personal-hash&user=my-username

Of course you can also just keep cortex as it is and browse the global reddit
frontpage as usual. See the cortex(1) manpage for more information about the
syntax and keybindings.
