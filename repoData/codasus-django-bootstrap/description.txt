Django Bootstrap
================

Django class-based views ready to work with Twitter's Bootstrap toolkit, designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.

Requirements
------------

* Django 1.3+
* Django 1.4+ (If you want to use SessionWizardView)

Installation
------------

Install through pip (or manually place it on your `PYTHON_PATH`).

    pip install git+http://github.com/codasus/django-bootstrap#egg=bootstrap

or just:

    pip install django-bootstrap

Configuration
-------------

Append `bootstrap` to `INSTALLED_APPS` tuple in your project's `settings.py`.

Example
-------

**urls.py**

```python
...

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url('^', include('contact_list.urls', namespace='contact_list')),
)
```

**contact_list/models.py**

_Take a look at `test_app/contact_list/models.py`_

**contact_list/forms.py**

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Contact

class ContactForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Contact
```

**contact_list/urls.py**

```python
from bootstrap.urls import bootstrap_patterns
from contact_list.forms import ContactForm

urlpatterns = bootstrap_patterns(ContactForm)
```

Well done! Just go to http://localhost:8000/contact

You may also create views separately using `bootstrap.urls` functions:

    bootstrap_list(r'object/', name[, view or model])
    bootstrap_create(r'object/add', name[, view or model])
    bootstrap_update(r'object/update/(?P<pk>\d+)/', name[, view or model])
    bootstrap_delete(r'object/delete/(?P<pk>\d+)/', name[, view or model])

**For example:**

```python
urlpatterns = patterns('',
        bootstrap_list(r'object/$',
                        'object_list',
                        view=ObjectListView.as_view()))
```

or

```python
urlpatterns = patterns('',
        bootstrap_list(r'object/$',
                        'object_list',
                        model=Object))
```
