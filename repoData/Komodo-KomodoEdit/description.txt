Release 1.0.5 (December 16, 2005)

====================================================================
The cElementTree module, release 1.0.5
====================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

The cElementTree module is a C implementation of the ElementTree API.
On typical documents, it's 15-20 times faster than the Python version
of ElementTree, and uses 2-5 times less memory.

Here are some benchmark results, using a number of popular XML tool-
kits to parse a 3405k source file from disk to memory, on my develop-
ment machine:

    library                     memory  time
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    minidom (python 2.1)        80000k  6.3s
    minidom (python 2.4)        53000k  1.4s
    ElementTree 1.3             14500k  1.1s
    cDomlette                   20500k  0.54s
    pyRXPU                      10850k  0.175s
    libxml2                     16000k  0.098s

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    readlines (read as utf-8)    8850k  0.093s
    readlines (read as ascii)    5050k  0.032s

and 

    http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm

For detailed information about changes/fixes in this release, see the
CHANGES document.

The current version is designed to work with Python 2.1 and newer,
with the exception of the 'iterparse' mechanism, which only works
under Python 2.2 and later.  Earlier Python versions are not supported
(let me know if you need support for 2.0 or 1.5.2).  For best per-
formance, use Python 2.4 or later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation

The cElementTree module is shipped as a distutils package.  To install
the library, unpack the distribution archive, and issue the following
command:

    $ python setup.py install

If you're using Windows, you can usually get prebuilt installers from
the effbot.org downloads site:

    http://effbot.org/downloads#celementtree

The current version depends on certain support functions and classes
from the ElementTree and ElementPath modules, so you must install the
standard elementtree package before you can use this library.  You can
get the elementtree distribution from:

    http://effbot.org/downloads#elementtree

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

The cElementTree module is designed to replace the ElementTree module
from the standard elementtree package.  In theory, you should be able
to simply change:

    from elementtree import ElementTree

to

    import cElementTree as ElementTree

in existing code, and run your programs without any problems (note
that cElementTree replaces the elementtree.ElementTree module, not the
elementtree package).  Some ElementTree 1.2 features may not be fully
supported by this release.  (Let me know if you find that something
you rely on doesn't work as expected.)

CHANGES                       List of changes in this release.

elementtree/

  ElementTree.py              Element tree implementation.  For a minimal
                              install, this file is all you need.

  ElementPath.py              Element path support module.  Adds limited
                              XPath support to find/findtext/findall.

  ElementInclude.py           Element include support module.  Adds limited
                              XInclude support.

  HTMLTreeBuilder.py          Element tree builder for HTML.  This only
                              works for mostly well-formed HTML; if you
                              need something that can parse arbitrary
                              HTML at least as good as your browser, use
                              TidyHTMLTreeBuilder or TidyTools (see below).

  XMLTreeBuilder.py           Element tree builder for XML (compatibility;
                              new code should use the tree builder in the
                              ElementTree module).

  TidyHTMLTreeBuilder.py      Element tree builder for HTML, based on the
                              tidylib library.  This tree builder requires
                              the _elementtidy extension module (available
                              from http://effbot.org/downloads).

  SimpleXMLTreeBuilder.py     Old element tree builder for XML, based on
                              xmllib, for Python versions where "expat" is
                              not available.   Due to bugs in xmllib, the
                              namespace support is not reliable (run the
                              module as a script to find out exactly how
                              unreliable it is on your Python version...)

  SgmlopXMLTreeBuilder.py     Simple element tree builder based on the
                              SGMLOP parser.  Note: The current version
                              does not support namespaces.

  SimpleXMLWriter.py          Simple XML writer

  TidyTools.py                Build element trees from HTML, using the
                              external 'tidy' utility.

html5lib
========

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/html5lib/html5lib-python.png?branch=master
  :target: https://travis-ci.org/html5lib/html5lib-python

html5lib is a pure-python library for parsing HTML. It is designed to
conform to the WHATWG HTML specification, as is implemented by all major
web browsers.


Usage
-----

Simple usage follows this pattern:

.. code-block:: python

  import html5lib
  with open("mydocument.html", "rb") as f:
      document = html5lib.parse(f)

or:

.. code-block:: python

  import html5lib
  document = html5lib.parse("<p>Hello World!")

By default, the ``document`` will be an ``xml.etree`` element instance.
Whenever possible, html5lib chooses the accelerated ``ElementTree``
implementation (i.e. ``xml.etree.cElementTree`` on Python 2.x).

Two other tree types are supported: ``xml.dom.minidom`` and
``lxml.etree``. To use an alternative format, specify the name of
a treebuilder:

.. code-block:: python

  import html5lib
  with open("mydocument.html", "rb") as f:
      lxml_etree_document = html5lib.parse(f, treebuilder="lxml")

When using with ``urllib2`` (Python 2), the charset from HTTP should be
pass into html5lib as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from contextlib import closing
  from urllib2 import urlopen
  import html5lib

  with closing(urlopen("http://example.com/")) as f:
      document = html5lib.parse(f, encoding=f.info().getparam("charset"))

When using with ``urllib.request`` (Python 3), the charset from HTTP
should be pass into html5lib as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from urllib.request import urlopen
  import html5lib

  with urlopen("http://example.com/") as f:
      document = html5lib.parse(f, encoding=f.info().get_content_charset())

To have more control over the parser, create a parser object explicitly.
For instance, to make the parser raise exceptions on parse errors, use:

.. code-block:: python

  import html5lib
  with open("mydocument.html", "rb") as f:
      parser = html5lib.HTMLParser(strict=True)
      document = parser.parse(f)

When you're instantiating parser objects explicitly, pass a treebuilder
class as the ``tree`` keyword argument to use an alternative document
format:

.. code-block:: python

  import html5lib
  parser = html5lib.HTMLParser(tree=html5lib.getTreeBuilder("dom"))
  minidom_document = parser.parse("<p>Hello World!")

More documentation is available at http://html5lib.readthedocs.org/.


Installation
------------

html5lib works on CPython 2.6+, CPython 3.2+ and PyPy.  To install it,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install html5lib


Optional Dependencies
---------------------

The following third-party libraries may be used for additional
functionality:

- ``datrie`` can be used to improve parsing performance (though in
  almost all cases the improvement is marginal);

- ``lxml`` is supported as a tree format (for both building and
  walking) under CPython (but *not* PyPy where it is known to cause
  segfaults);

- ``genshi`` has a treewalker (but not builder); and

- ``charade`` can be used as a fallback when character encoding cannot
  be determined; ``chardet``, from which it was forked, can also be used
  on Python 2.

- ``ordereddict`` can be used under Python 2.6
  (``collections.OrderedDict`` is used instead on later versions) to
  serialize attributes in alphabetical order.


Bugs
----

Please report any bugs on the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python/issues>`_.


Tests
-----

Unit tests require the ``nose`` library and can be run using the
``nosetests`` command in the root directory; ``ordereddict`` is
required under Python 2.6. All should pass.

Test data are contained in a separate `html5lib-tests
<https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests>`_ repository and included
as a submodule, thus for git checkouts they must be initialized::

  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

If you have all compatible Python implementations available on your
system, you can run tests on all of them using the ``tox`` utility,
which can be found on PyPI.


Questions?
----------

There's a mailing list available for support on Google Groups,
`html5lib-discuss <http://groups.google.com/group/html5lib-discuss>`_,
though you may get a quicker response asking on IRC in `#whatwg on
irc.freenode.net <http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC>`_.

# README for 'mk' project

<http://svn.openkomodo.com/repos/mk>

This is a Makefile/make replacement written in Python. You put a
`Makefile.py` at the base of your project. Makefile tasks are classes
that subclass from `mklib.Task`. Then you run `mk TASK` like you would run
GNU `make TASK`.

TODO: fill out this readme, obviously a lot more needs to be documented

paramiko
========

:Paramiko: Python SSH module
:Copyright: Copyright (c) 2003-2009  Robey Pointer <robeypointer@gmail.com>
:License: LGPL
:Homepage: http://www.lag.net/paramiko/


paramiko 1.7.7.1
================

"George" release, 21 may 2011


What
----

"paramiko" is a combination of the esperanto words for "paranoid" and
"friend".  it's a module for python 2.2+ that implements the SSH2 protocol
for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines.
unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical
certificates signed by a powerful central authority. you may know SSH2 as
the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote
shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary
channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel (this is how sftp
works, for example).

it is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and is
released under the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL). 

the package and its API is fairly well documented in the "doc/" folder
that should have come with this archive.


Requirements
------------

  - python 2.3 or better <http://www.python.org/>
    (python 2.2 is also supported, but not recommended)
  - pycrypto 2.1 or better <https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/>

If you have setuptools, you can build and install paramiko and all its
dependencies with this command (as root)::

    easy_install ./


Portability
-----------

i code and test this library on Linux and MacOS X. for that reason, i'm
pretty sure that it works for all posix platforms, including MacOS. it
should also work on Windows, though i don't test it as frequently there.
if you run into Windows problems, send me a patch: portability is important
to me.

python 2.2 may work, thanks to some patches from Roger Binns. things to
watch out for:

    * sockets in 2.2 don't support timeouts, so the 'select' module is
      imported to do polling.  
    * logging is mostly stubbed out. it works just enough to let paramiko
      create log files for debugging, if you want them. to get real logging,
      you can backport python 2.3's logging package. Roger has done that
      already:
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=75211&package_id=113804

you really should upgrade to python 2.3. laziness is no excuse! :)

some python distributions don't include the utf-8 string encodings, for
reasons of space (misdirected as that is). if your distribution is
missing encodings, you'll see an error like this::

    LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

this means you need to copy string encodings over from a working system.
(it probably only happens on embedded systems, not normal python
installs.) Valeriy Pogrebitskiy says the best place to look is
``.../lib/python*/encodings/__init__.py``.


Bugs & Support
--------------

there's a launchpage page for paramiko, with a bug tracker:

    https://launchpad.net/paramiko/
    
this is the primary place to file and browse bug reports.

there's also a low-traffic mailing list for support and discussions:

    http://www.lag.net/mailman/listinfo/paramiko


Demo
----

several demo scripts come with paramiko to demonstrate how to use it.
probably the simplest demo of all is this::

    import paramiko, base64
    key = paramiko.RSAKey(data=base64.decodestring('AAA...'))
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.get_host_keys().add('ssh.example.com', 'ssh-rsa', key)
    client.connect('ssh.example.com', username='strongbad', password='thecheat')
    stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls')
    for line in stdout:
        print '... ' + line.strip('\n')
    client.close()

...which prints out the results of executing ``ls`` on a remote server.
(the host key 'AAA...' should of course be replaced by the actual base64
encoding of the host key.  if you skip host key verification, the
connection is not secure!)

the following example scripts (in demos/) get progressively more detailed:

:demo_simple.py:
    calls invoke_shell() and emulates a terminal/tty through which you can
    execute commands interactively on a remote server.  think of it as a
    poor man's ssh command-line client.

:demo.py:
    same as demo_simple.py, but allows you to authenticiate using a
    private key, attempts to use an SSH-agent if present, and uses the long
    form of some of the API calls.

:forward.py:
    command-line script to set up port-forwarding across an ssh transport.
    (requires python 2.3.)

:demo_sftp.py:
    opens an sftp session and does a few simple file operations.

:demo_server.py:
    an ssh server that listens on port 2200 and accepts a login for
    'robey' (password 'foo'), and pretends to be a BBS.  meant to be a
    very simple demo of writing an ssh server.


Use
---

the demo scripts are probably the best example of how to use this package.
there is also a lot of documentation, generated with epydoc, in the doc/
folder.  point your browser there.  seriously, do it.  mad props to
epydoc, which actually motivated me to write more documentation than i
ever would have before.

there are also unit tests here::

    $ python ./test.py

which will verify that most of the core components are working correctly.

Patches for Komodo contrib (i.e. 3rd-party) code.

Two sets of patches here:
1. Those that are *already applied* to the sources in
   "contrib/<project>/...". This is most of them.
2. Those that are applied *as part of the build*. This
   includes:
   - contrib/patches/scintilla/...
     Handled by "bk build" (see GetScintillaSource() in Blackfile.py).

Currently the *building* of any of these source tree is handled by
"contrib/Conscript" -- with the exception of "contrib/scintilla".


pathtools
=========

Pattern matching and various utilities for file systems paths.



README
README file for PCRE (Perl-compatible regular expression library)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The latest release of PCRE is always available from

  ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-xxx.tar.gz

Please read the NEWS file if you are upgrading from a previous release.


The PCRE APIs
-------------

PCRE is written in C, and it has its own API. The distribution now includes a
set of C++ wrapper functions, courtesy of Google Inc. (see the pcrecpp man page
for details).

Also included are a set of C wrapper functions that are based on the POSIX
API. These end up in the library called libpcreposix. Note that this just
provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE: the regular expressions themselves
still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The header file for the POSIX-style
functions is called pcreposix.h. The official POSIX name is regex.h, but I
didn't want to risk possible problems with existing files of that name by
distributing it that way. To use it with an existing program that uses the
POSIX API, it will have to be renamed or pointed at by a link.

If you are using the POSIX interface to PCRE and there is already a POSIX regex
library installed on your system, you must take care when linking programs to
ensure that they link with PCRE's libpcreposix library. Otherwise they may pick
up the "real" POSIX functions of the same name.


Documentation for PCRE
----------------------

If you install PCRE in the normal way, you will end up with an installed set of
man pages whose names all start with "pcre". The one that is called "pcre"
lists all the others. In addition to these man pages, the PCRE documentation is
supplied in two other forms; however, as there is no standard place to install
them, they are left in the doc directory of the unpacked source distribution.
These forms are:

  1. Files called doc/pcre.txt, doc/pcregrep.txt, and doc/pcretest.txt. The
     first of these is a concatenation of the text forms of all the section 3
     man pages except those that summarize individual functions. The other two
     are the text forms of the section 1 man pages for the pcregrep and
     pcretest commands. Text forms are provided for ease of scanning with text
     editors or similar tools.

  2. A subdirectory called doc/html contains all the documentation in HTML
     form, hyperlinked in various ways, and rooted in a file called
     doc/index.html.


Contributions by users of PCRE
------------------------------

You can find contributions from PCRE users in the directory

  ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/Contrib

where there is also a README file giving brief descriptions of what they are.
Several of them provide support for compiling PCRE on various flavours of
Windows systems (I myself do not use Windows). Some are complete in themselves;
others are pointers to URLs containing relevant files.


Building PCRE on a Unix-like system
-----------------------------------

To build PCRE on a Unix-like system, first run the "configure" command from the
PCRE distribution directory, with your current directory set to the directory
where you want the files to be created. This command is a standard GNU
"autoconf" configuration script, for which generic instructions are supplied in
INSTALL.

Most commonly, people build PCRE within its own distribution directory, and in
this case, on many systems, just running "./configure" is sufficient, but the
usual methods of changing standard defaults are available. For example:

CFLAGS='-O2 -Wall' ./configure --prefix=/opt/local

specifies that the C compiler should be run with the flags '-O2 -Wall' instead
of the default, and that "make install" should install PCRE under /opt/local
instead of the default /usr/local.

If you want to build in a different directory, just run "configure" with that
directory as current. For example, suppose you have unpacked the PCRE source
into /source/pcre/pcre-xxx, but you want to build it in /build/pcre/pcre-xxx:

cd /build/pcre/pcre-xxx
/source/pcre/pcre-xxx/configure

There are some optional features that can be included or omitted from the PCRE
library. You can read more about them in the pcrebuild man page.

. If you want to suppress the building of the C++ wrapper library, you can add
  --disable-cpp to the "configure" command. Otherwise, when "configure" is run,
  will try to find a C++ compiler and C++ header files, and if it succeeds, it
  will try to build the C++ wrapper.

. If you want to make use of the support for UTF-8 character strings in PCRE,
  you must add --enable-utf8 to the "configure" command. Without it, the code
  for handling UTF-8 is not included in the library. (Even when included, it
  still has to be enabled by an option at run time.)

. If, in addition to support for UTF-8 character strings, you want to include
  support for the \P, \p, and \X sequences that recognize Unicode character
  properties, you must add --enable-unicode-properties to the "configure"
  command. This adds about 90K to the size of the library (in the form of a
  property table); only the basic two-letter properties such as Lu are
  supported.

. You can build PCRE to recognized CR or NL as the newline character, instead
  of whatever your compiler uses for "\n", by adding --newline-is-cr or
  --newline-is-nl to the "configure" command, respectively. Only do this if you
  really understand what you are doing. On traditional Unix-like systems, the
  newline character is NL.

. When called via the POSIX interface, PCRE uses malloc() to get additional
  storage for processing capturing parentheses if there are more than 10 of
  them. You can increase this threshold by setting, for example,

  --with-posix-malloc-threshold=20

  on the "configure" command.

. PCRE has a counter that can be set to limit the amount of resources it uses.
  If the limit is exceeded during a match, the match fails. The default is ten
  million. You can change the default by setting, for example,

  --with-match-limit=500000

  on the "configure" command. This is just the default; individual calls to
  pcre_exec() can supply their own value. There is discussion on the pcreapi
  man page.

. The default maximum compiled pattern size is around 64K. You can increase
  this by adding --with-link-size=3 to the "configure" command. You can
  increase it even more by setting --with-link-size=4, but this is unlikely
  ever to be necessary. If you build PCRE with an increased link size, test 2
  (and 5 if you are using UTF-8) will fail. Part of the output of these tests
  is a representation of the compiled pattern, and this changes with the link
  size.

. You can build PCRE so that its internal match() function that is called from
  pcre_exec() does not call itself recursively. Instead, it uses blocks of data
  from the heap via special functions pcre_stack_malloc() and pcre_stack_free()
  to save data that would otherwise be saved on the stack. To build PCRE like
  this, use

  --disable-stack-for-recursion

  on the "configure" command. PCRE runs more slowly in this mode, but it may be
  necessary in environments with limited stack sizes. This applies only to the
  pcre_exec() function; it does not apply to pcre_dfa_exec(), which does not
  use deeply nested recursion.

The "configure" script builds eight files for the basic C library:

. pcre.h is the header file for C programs that call PCRE
. Makefile is the makefile that builds the library
. config.h contains build-time configuration options for the library
. pcre-config is a script that shows the settings of "configure" options
. libpcre.pc is data for the pkg-config command
. libtool is a script that builds shared and/or static libraries
. RunTest is a script for running tests on the library
. RunGrepTest is a script for running tests on the pcregrep command

In addition, if a C++ compiler is found, the following are also built:

. pcrecpp.h is the header file for programs that call PCRE via the C++ wrapper
. pcre_stringpiece.h is the header for the C++ "stringpiece" functions

The "configure" script also creates config.status, which is an executable
script that can be run to recreate the configuration, and config.log, which
contains compiler output from tests that "configure" runs.

Once "configure" has run, you can run "make". It builds two libraries, called
libpcre and libpcreposix, a test program called pcretest, and the pcregrep
command. If a C++ compiler was found on your system, it also builds the C++
wrapper library, which is called libpcrecpp, and some test programs called
pcrecpp_unittest, pcre_scanner_unittest, and pcre_stringpiece_unittest.

The command "make test" runs all the appropriate tests. Details of the PCRE
tests are given in a separate section of this document, below.

You can use "make install" to copy the libraries, the public header files
pcre.h, pcreposix.h, pcrecpp.h, and pcre_stringpiece.h (the last two only if
the C++ wrapper was built), and the man pages to appropriate live directories
on your system, in the normal way.

If you want to remove PCRE from your system, you can run "make uninstall".
This removes all the files that "make install" installed. However, it does not
remove any directories, because these are often shared with other programs.


Retrieving configuration information on Unix-like systems
---------------------------------------------------------

Running "make install" also installs the command pcre-config, which can be used
to recall information about the PCRE configuration and installation. For
example:

  pcre-config --version

prints the version number, and

  pcre-config --libs

outputs information about where the library is installed. This command can be
included in makefiles for programs that use PCRE, saving the programmer from
having to remember too many details.

The pkg-config command is another system for saving and retrieving information
about installed libraries. Instead of separate commands for each library, a
single command is used. For example:

  pkg-config --cflags pcre

The data is held in *.pc files that are installed in a directory called
pkgconfig.


Shared libraries on Unix-like systems
-------------------------------------

The default distribution builds PCRE as shared libraries and static libraries,
as long as the operating system supports shared libraries. Shared library
support relies on the "libtool" script which is built as part of the
"configure" process.

The libtool script is used to compile and link both shared and static
libraries. They are placed in a subdirectory called .libs when they are newly
built. The programs pcretest and pcregrep are built to use these uninstalled
libraries (by means of wrapper scripts in the case of shared libraries). When
you use "make install" to install shared libraries, pcregrep and pcretest are
automatically re-built to use the newly installed shared libraries before being
installed themselves. However, the versions left in the source directory still
use the uninstalled libraries.

To build PCRE using static libraries only you must use --disable-shared when
configuring it. For example:

./configure --prefix=/usr/gnu --disable-shared

Then run "make" in the usual way. Similarly, you can use --disable-static to
build only shared libraries.


Cross-compiling on a Unix-like system
-------------------------------------

You can specify CC and CFLAGS in the normal way to the "configure" command, in
order to cross-compile PCRE for some other host. However, during the building
process, the dftables.c source file is compiled *and run* on the local host, in
order to generate the default character tables (the chartables.c file). It
therefore needs to be compiled with the local compiler, not the cross compiler.
You can do this by specifying CC_FOR_BUILD (and if necessary CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD;
there are also CXX_FOR_BUILD and CXXFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for the C++ wrapper)
when calling the "configure" command. If they are not specified, they default
to the values of CC and CFLAGS.


Building on non-Unix systems
----------------------------

For a non-Unix system, read the comments in the file NON-UNIX-USE, though if
the system supports the use of "configure" and "make" you may be able to build
PCRE in the same way as for Unix systems.

PCRE has been compiled on Windows systems and on Macintoshes, but I don't know
the details because I don't use those systems. It should be straightforward to
build PCRE on any system that has a Standard C compiler, because it uses only
Standard C functions.


Testing PCRE
------------

To test PCRE on a Unix system, run the RunTest script that is created by the
configuring process. There is also a script called RunGrepTest that tests the
options of the pcregrep command. If the C++ wrapper library is build, three
test programs called pcrecpp_unittest, pcre_scanner_unittest, and
pcre_stringpiece_unittest are provided.

Both the scripts and all the program tests are run if you obey "make runtest",
"make check", or "make test". For other systems, see the instructions in
NON-UNIX-USE.

The RunTest script runs the pcretest test program (which is documented in its
own man page) on each of the testinput files (in the testdata directory) in
turn, and compares the output with the contents of the corresponding testoutput
file. A file called testtry is used to hold the main output from pcretest
(testsavedregex is also used as a working file). To run pcretest on just one of
the test files, give its number as an argument to RunTest, for example:

  RunTest 2

The first file can also be fed directly into the perltest script to check that
Perl gives the same results. The only difference you should see is in the first
few lines, where the Perl version is given instead of the PCRE version.

The second set of tests check pcre_fullinfo(), pcre_info(), pcre_study(),
pcre_copy_substring(), pcre_get_substring(), pcre_get_substring_list(), error
detection, and run-time flags that are specific to PCRE, as well as the POSIX
wrapper API. It also uses the debugging flag to check some of the internals of
pcre_compile().

If you build PCRE with a locale setting that is not the standard C locale, the
character tables may be different (see next paragraph). In some cases, this may
cause failures in the second set of tests. For example, in a locale where the
isprint() function yields TRUE for characters in the range 128-255, the use of
[:isascii:] inside a character class defines a different set of characters, and
this shows up in this test as a difference in the compiled code, which is being
listed for checking. Where the comparison test output contains [\x00-\x7f] the
test will contain [\x00-\xff], and similarly in some other cases. This is not a
bug in PCRE.

The third set of tests checks pcre_maketables(), the facility for building a
set of character tables for a specific locale and using them instead of the
default tables. The tests make use of the "fr_FR" (French) locale. Before
running the test, the script checks for the presence of this locale by running
the "locale" command. If that command fails, or if it doesn't include "fr_FR"
in the list of available locales, the third test cannot be run, and a comment
is output to say why. If running this test produces instances of the error

  ** Failed to set locale "fr_FR"

in the comparison output, it means that locale is not available on your system,
despite being listed by "locale". This does not mean that PCRE is broken.

The fourth test checks the UTF-8 support. It is not run automatically unless
PCRE is built with UTF-8 support. To do this you must set --enable-utf8 when
running "configure". This file can be also fed directly to the perltest script,
provided you are running Perl 5.8 or higher. (For Perl 5.6, a small patch,
commented in the script, can be be used.)

The fifth test checks error handling with UTF-8 encoding, and internal UTF-8
features of PCRE that are not relevant to Perl.

The sixth and test checks the support for Unicode character properties. It it
not run automatically unless PCRE is built with Unicode property support. To to
this you must set --enable-unicode-properties when running "configure".

The seventh, eighth, and ninth tests check the pcre_dfa_exec() alternative
matching function, in non-UTF-8 mode, UTF-8 mode, and UTF-8 mode with Unicode
property support, respectively. The eighth and ninth tests are not run
automatically unless PCRE is build with the relevant support.


Character tables
----------------

PCRE uses four tables for manipulating and identifying characters whose values
are less than 256. The final argument of the pcre_compile() function is a
pointer to a block of memory containing the concatenated tables. A call to
pcre_maketables() can be used to generate a set of tables in the current
locale. If the final argument for pcre_compile() is passed as NULL, a set of
default tables that is built into the binary is used.

The source file called chartables.c contains the default set of tables. This is
not supplied in the distribution, but is built by the program dftables
(compiled from dftables.c), which uses the ANSI C character handling functions
such as isalnum(), isalpha(), isupper(), islower(), etc. to build the table
sources. This means that the default C locale which is set for your system will
control the contents of these default tables. You can change the default tables
by editing chartables.c and then re-building PCRE. If you do this, you should
probably also edit Makefile to ensure that the file doesn't ever get
re-generated.

The first two 256-byte tables provide lower casing and case flipping functions,
respectively. The next table consists of three 32-byte bit maps which identify
digits, "word" characters, and white space, respectively. These are used when
building 32-byte bit maps that represent character classes.

The final 256-byte table has bits indicating various character types, as
follows:

    1   white space character
    2   letter
    4   decimal digit
    8   hexadecimal digit
   16   alphanumeric or '_'
  128   regular expression metacharacter or binary zero

You should not alter the set of characters that contain the 128 bit, as that
will cause PCRE to malfunction.

Building PCRE for Windows
=========================

This directory contains ActiveState-added build support files for PCRE for
Windows.

vc6: Visual C++ 6
-----------------

Originally the Visual C++ 6 build files were added. At least I *believe* so.
ActiveState's original checkin of these files (p4 change 256935, in
//depot/main/support/pcre/Win32/...) doesn't give details.

    pcre.dsw
    pcre.dsp
    libpcre.dsp
    dftables.dsp
    (... there are others, but the four above are the main ones...)

To build with these:

1. Open "pcre.dsw" in the Visual C++ 6 IDE.
2. Build.


vc7: Visual Studio .NET 2003 (vs7.1)
------------------------------------

In p4 change 263072 in the //depot/main/Apps/Komodo-devel/... tree, some
build support files for Visual Studio 7.1 were added.

    libpcre.sln
    dftables.sln

Currently these aren't used by Komodo -- mainly because Komodo builds don't
use vc7.


vc8: Visual Studio 2005
-----------------------

Instead of adding Visual Studio project files (.sln, .vcproj) for
VC8 (aka Visual Studio 2005) and VC9 (aka Visual Studio 2008) etc., I've just
exported makefiles from the VC6 project files:

    libpcre.mak
    libpcre.dep
    dftables.mak
    dftables.dep
    pcregrep.mak
    pcregrep.dep
    pcretest.mak
    pcretest.dep
    tests.mak
    tests.dep

This should allow building with any Visual Studio/C++ compiler. See the next
section.

Note: These makefiles should be improved to deal with some compiler
warnings from more recent versions of Visual C++. For example, vc8 warns:

    cl.exe /nologo /MT /W3 /GX /O2 /I "Win32" /I "." /D "WIN32" /D "NDEBUG" /D "_MBCS" /D "_LIB" /D "PCRE_STATIC" /Fp".\Release\libpcre.pch" /YX /Fo".\Release\\" /Fd".\Release\\" /FD /c ..\pcre_config.c
    cl : Command line warning D9035 : option 'GX' has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release
    cl : Command line warning D9036 : use 'EHsc' instead of 'GX'
    cl : Command line warning D9002 : ignoring unknown option '/YX'


Building PCRE with any MSVC compiler version
--------------------------------------------


1. Setup your shell environment for the appropriate Visual Studio/Visual
   C++. Typically this is done by either:

   (a) Running the "Command Prompt" shortcut in the Start Menu folder for
       that version of visual studio; or
   (b) Running the "vcvars32.bat" environment script provided with each
       version of Visual Studio. Examples:

       - vc6:
         "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32.bat"
       - vc7:
         "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\bin\vcvars32.bat"
       - vc8:
         "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat"
         "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin\x86_amd64\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat" (cross-compile for x64 arch)
       - vc9:
         "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat"
         "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\x86_amd64\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat" (cross-compile for x64 arch)

2. Build the "dftables" and "libpcre" projects:

    cd Win32
    nmake -nologo -f dftables.mak
    nmake -nologo -f libpcre.mak

   The build output should be in the "Release" subdir.



Python Cryptography Toolkit (pycrypto)
======================================

This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and
RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal,
etc.).  The package is structured to make adding new modules easy.
This section is essentially complete, and the software interface will
almost certainly not change in an incompatible way in the future; all
that remains to be done is to fix any bugs that show up.  If you
encounter a bug, please report it in the Launchpad bug tracker at

       https://launchpad.net/products/pycrypto/+bugs

An example usage of the SHA256 module is:
>>> from Crypto.Hash import SHA256
>>> hash = SHA256.new()
>>> hash.update('message')
>>> hash.digest()
'\xabS\n\x13\xe4Y\x14\x98+y\xf9\xb7\xe3\xfb\xa9\x94\xcf\xd1\xf3\xfb"\xf7\x1c\xea\x1a\xfb\xf0+F\x0cm\x1d'

An example usage of an encryption algorithm (AES, in this case) is:

>>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES
>>> obj = AES.new('This is a key456', AES.MODE_ECB)
>>> message = "The answer is no"
>>> ciphertext = obj.encrypt(message)
>>> ciphertext
'o\x1aq_{P+\xd0\x07\xce\x89\xd1=M\x989'
>>> obj2 = AES.new('This is a key456', AES.MODE_ECB)
>>> obj2.decrypt(ciphertext)
'The answer is no'

One possible application of the modules is writing secure
administration tools.  Another application is in writing daemons and
servers.  Clients and servers can encrypt the data being exchanged and
mutually authenticate themselves; daemons can encrypt private data for
added security.  Python also provides a pleasant framework for
prototyping and experimentation with cryptographic algorithms; thanks
to its arbitrary-length integers, public key algorithms are easily
implemented.

As of PyCrypto 2.1.0, PyCrypto provides an easy-to-use random number
generator:

>>> from Crypto import Random
>>> rndfile = Random.new()
>>> rndfile.read(16)
'\xf7.\x838{\x85\xa0\xd3>#}\xc6\xc2jJU'

A stronger version of Python's standard "random" module is also
provided:

>>> from Crypto.Random import random
>>> random.choice(['dogs', 'cats', 'bears'])
'bears'

Caveat: For the random number generator to work correctly, you must
call Random.atfork() in both the parent and child processes after
using os.fork()


Installation
============

PyCrypto is written and tested using Python version 2.1 through 2.6,
though support for Python 2.1 will be dropped soon.  Python 1.5.2 is
not supported.

The modules are packaged using the Distutils, so you can simply run
"python setup.py build" to build the package, and "python setup.py
install" to install it.

If the setup.py script crashes with a DistutilsPlatformError
complaining that the file /usr/lib/python2.2/config/Makefile doesn't
exist, this means that the files needed for compiling new Python
modules aren't installed on your system.  Red Hat users often run into
this because they don't have the python2-devel RPM installed.  The fix
is to simply install the requisite RPM.  On Debian/Ubuntu, you need the
python-dev package.

To verify that everything is in order, run "python setup.py test".  It
will test all the cryptographic modules, skipping ones that aren't
available.  If the test script reports an error on your machine,
please report the bug using the bug tracker (URL given above).  If
possible, track down the bug and include a patch that fixes it,
provided that you are able to meet the eligibility requirements at
http://www.pycrypto.org/submission-requirements/.

To install the package under the site-packages directory of
your Python installation, run "python setup.py install".

If you have any comments, corrections, or improvements for this
package, please report them to our mailing list, accessible via the
PyCrypto website:

    http://www.pycrypto.org/



wnd is a python only gui framework for win32 systems, 
using low level MS api calls. It lets you setup highly native
guis with low memory footprint and low distibution size. 
 
The module comes equipped with wrapper classes for  
comon controls, common dialogs, classes wrapping gdi 
functionality, a bare bones dialog and menu editor and other
modules peeking into the world of the win32 api. A documentation
in chm format comes shipped along with the module

README for building of Scintilla on Qt

There are three different Scintilla libraries that can be produced:

	ScintillaEditBase
A basic widget callable from C++ which is small and can be used just as is 
or with higher level functionality added.

	ScintillaEdit
A more complete C++ widget with a method for every Scintilla API and a
secondary API allowing direct access to document objects.

	ScintillaEditPy
A Python callable version of ScintillaEdit using the PySide bindings.

	Building a library

ScintillaEditBase can be built without performing any generation steps.
The ScintillaEditBase/ScintillaEditBase.pro project can be loaded into 
Qt Creator and the "Build All" command performed.
Alternatively, run "qmake" to build make files and then use the platform
make to build. Most commonly, use "make" on Unix and "nmake"
on Windows.

ScintillaEdit requires a generation command be run first. From the 
ScintillaEdit directory:

python WidgetGen.py

After the generation command has run, the ScintillaEdit.h and
ScintillaEdit.cpp files will have been populated with the Scintilla API
methods. 
To build, use Qt Creator or qmake and make as for ScintillaEditBase.

ScintillaEditPy is more complex and instructions are found in 
ScintillaEditPy/README.

README for building of ScintillaEditPy on Qt with PySide

This directory is for building a Python encapsulation of Scintilla for use
with PySide. For C++ libraries see the README in the parent directory.

	Prerequisites
	
PySide and ScintillaEditPy currently only support Python 2.x.

CMake may be used to rebuild PySide and is required on Windows.
It can be downloaded from
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

On Windows, PySide only supports Visual C++ 2008. The "Visual Studio 2008
Command Prompt" should be used to run all build commands.
Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition can be downloaded from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/express/future/bb421473

Download and install PySide. Instructions are on the PySide web site
http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads

For Linux, there may be both PySide library packages and PySide development
files. Both should be installed as ScintillaEditPy needs the headers and
libraries from the development package and runs with the normal library package.
On apt-based systems, the packages are libshiboken-dev, shiboken, libpyside-dev,
and python-pyside. python-dev is also needed for Python language headers.
On yum-based systems the packages are shiboken-devel, python-pyside-devel,
and python-devel.
The qmake program may not be in the path and can be found with
"find /usr -name qmake".

On Windows, the PySide library packages can be downloaded from 
http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Binaries_Windows
The PySide development files must be built from source using CMake as 
described on the PySide site. This will create a Unix-style set of [bin, include,
lib, and share] directories in packaging\setuptools\install-py<ver>-qt<qver>. 
There is no standard place for the PySide development files so copy them
to "\usr", creating it if needed.

On OS X, a combined package with PySide libraries and PySide development
files can be downloaded from 
http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Binaries_MacOSX
This package works best in combination with the Qt libraries for Mac from
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/downloads#qt-lib

The path should be modified so that a Python 2.x interpreter and Qt's "qmake"
program can be run by typing "python" or "qmake".

	Building

There are several steps to building and they are encapsulated in the sepbuild.py
script which is run:

python sepbuild.py

This script first runs the WidgetGen.py script to fill out the ScintillaEdit.h, 
ScintillaEdit.cpp and ScintillaConstants.py files.

A short file "sepbuild.pri" is written out which contains a series of version and 
path properties discovered by sepbuild.py which are used by qmake.

Then it runs PySide's "shiboken" program to create C++ code that will act as a
bridge between Python and the C++ libraries. This code goes into the 
ScintillaEditPy/ScintillaEditPy directory. Several log files are produced which can
help uncover problems in the bridge if it fails to build.

The qmake program is run to produce make files from ScintillaEditPy.pro.

The system make program is then run to build the library. The library is located in
the scintilla/bin directory as ScintillaEditPy.so for Unix systems and 
ScintillaEditPy.pyd for Windows.

A demonstration program can be run:

python testsepq.py

The individual steps in the script can be run manually if wanted although the
shiboken program has complex arguments and differs between systems so run 
sepbuild.py and copy the section starting with a line containing "generatorrunner"
and continuing to "typesystem_ScintillaEdit.xml".

On Windows, it is more difficult to set up an environment to debug ScintillaEditPy
since all the libraries have to be debug or all have to be release. The easy path 
is to always build for release with "nmake release".

To remove generated code, run "python sepbuild.py --clean".

README for building of Scintilla and SciTE

Scintilla can be built by itself.
To build SciTE, Scintilla must first be built.


*** GTK+/Linux version ***

You must first have GTK+ 2.0 or later and GCC (4.1 or better) installed.
GTK+ 1.x will not work.
Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.

To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla/gtk
	make
	cd ../..

To build and install SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
	cd scite/gtk
	make
	make install

This installs SciTE into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from
the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed
with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed
/usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command
line like "make prefix=/opt" but the same value should be used for both make
and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global
properties file is installed at $prefix/share/scite/SciTEGlobal.properties.
The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory.

To remove SciTE
	make uninstall

To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix
	make clean

The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.


*** Windows version ***

A C++ compiler is required. Visual Studio .NET 2010 is the development system
used for most development although TDM Mingw32 4.4.1 is also supported.

To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/win32 directory
		cd scintilla\win32
GCC:		mingw32-make
VS .NET:	nmake -f scintilla.mak
		cd ..\..

To build SciTE, use the makefiles located in the scite/win32 directory
		cd scite\win32
GCC:		mingw32-make
VS .NET: 	nmake -f scite.mak

An executable SciTE will now be in scite\bin.

The Visual C++ 6.0 project (.dsp) and make files are no longer supported but are left
in the download for people that are prepared to update them.

*** GTK+/Windows version ***

Mingw32 is known to work. Other compilers will probably not work.

Only Scintilla will build with GTK+ on Windows. SciTE will not work.

To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla\gtk
	mingw32-make

The test directory contains some unit and performance tests for Scintilla.

The tests can only be run on Windows or Linux/Qt using Python 2.7 or 3.x.
Python 2.7+ is required because the bytes string type and literals are available.
Scintilla must be built before running any tests.

A test application for Windows only is in xite.py and this can be run to experiment:
pythonw xite.py

To run the basic tests:
python simpleTests.py

There are some lexing tests with simple input files in several languages in the examples 
subdirectory and their expected lexed states in *.styled where the start of each style 
is marked with {styleNumber}, for example:
{15}<%@{16}language=javas{15}%>{0}

To run the lexing tests:
python lexTests.py

To check for performance regressions:
python performanceTests.py
While each test run will be different and the timer has only limited granularity, some results
from a 2 GHz Athlon with a DEBUG build are:
 0.187 testAddLine
. 0.203 testAddLineMiddle
. 0.171 testHuge
. 0.203 testHugeInserts
. 0.312 testHugeReplace
.

The test/unit directory contains unit tests for Scintilla data structures.

The tests can be run on Windows or Linux using g++ and GNU make.
The Google Test framework is used.
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

Google test must be installed first.
On Linux, install the google test packages libgtest-dev and libgtest0.
On Windows download Google test and install it as a peer to the directory
containing scintilla. The makefile assumes it is in ../../../../gtest-1.5.0.

To run the tests:
make
./unitTest

=============================
The sgmlop accelerator module
=============================

The sgmlop module provides an optimized SGML/XML parser, designed as
an add-on to the sgmllib/htmllib and xmllib modules shipped with
Python 1.5 and later.

This driver is typically 5-10 times faster than the original xmllib
implementation.  When using sgmlop's native interface, it can be more
than 50 times faster.

However, sgmlop is (by design) a very tolerant parser.  It will parse
virtually anything into a stream of start tags, entities, end tags,
and text sections.  If you need careful well-formedness checking, use
expat instead.

Enjoy /F

changes from 1.0 (latest first)
-------------------------------

(The following list may be somewhat incomplete)

- Inside attribute values, character references larger than 255
  are now passed to resolve_entityref (as '#nnnn').

- Fixed segmentation violation when parsing non-ASCII character
  entities in attribute values (reported and fixed by Jeff Chan).

(1.1 released)

- Fixed potential segmentation violation when parsing non-ASCII
  character entities.

(1.1 beta 2 released)

- Fixed garbage support for Python 2.2 and later.  (Thanks to Neal
  Schemenauer for pointing out the problems with the approach used
  in 1.1 beta 1, and providing improved compatibility macros).

- Fixed parsing of target-only PI's (reported by Walter Drwald).

(1.1 beta 1 released)

- Added support for garbage collection, under Python 2.0 and
  later.  Under 1.5.2, you must still make sure to call the
  close method on all parser instances.

- Changed behaviour for character references that doesn't fit
  in an 8-bit character.  Basically, you must define a charref
  handler (handle_charref) if you're interested in such data.

(1.1 alpha 3 released)

- Repaired parsing of <empty/> tags that didn't have a white-
  space between the tag name and the slash; the non-ASCII change
  in alpha 1 broke this, and the test suite didn't catch the bug.
  (reported by Matthew King)

(1.1 alpha 2 released)

- Entities in attributes are now properly resolved.  Standard
  entities (amp, apos, gt, lt, quot) and character entities always
  work; other entities are mapped through the resolve_entityref
  callback (see below).

- Added brief documentation (module-sgmlop.html, sgmlop.css)

(1.1 alpha 1 released)

- A new callback, resolve_entityref, has been added.  This handler
  is called for named entities if the handle_entityref callback
  isn't defined.  This callback will also be used to resolve
  entities in attributes.

  If neither resolve_entityref or handle_entityref are defined,
  but handle_data is defined, sgmlop generates character data for
  the standard entities (amp, apos, gt, lt, quot).

- Hexadecimal character references are now supported.

- Malformed character references (&#nnn;) are treated as ordinary
  entities, if handle_charref isn't defined.

- The XML tag and entity parsers now treats all characters above
  chr(128) as letters, independent of the current locale.  This
  should make it easier to use sgmlop with non-ASCII characters
  in tags.

- sgmlop now resolves standard entities (apos, quot, gt, lt, amp)
  by itself, if handle_entityref isn't defined.

- SGML files containing text only wasn't properly handled.  the parser
  never consumed the last character, not even if the 'close' method
  was called (reported by Walter Drwald)

- Unicode strings (under 1.6) were treated as binary buffers.  In this
  release, the parser can properly parse 16-bit strings, but the
  callbacks get 8-bit UTF-8 strings, not true Unicode strings.  This
  will be fixed in a future release.

- The 'close' method no longer accepts an optional argument.  Use a
  separate call to 'feed' instead.

- Recursive calls to 'feed' or 'close' (from within a callback) could
  lead to all sorts of weird problems.  This version checks for this
  condition, and raises an AssertionError instead.

This directory exists so that Subversion-based projects can share a single
copy of the ``ez_setup`` bootstrap module for ``setuptools``, and have it
automatically updated in their projects when ``setuptools`` is updated.

For your convenience, you may use the following svn:externals definition::

    ez_setup svn://svn.eby-sarna.com/svnroot/ez_setup

You can set this by executing this command in your project directory::

    svn propedit svn:externals .

And then adding the line shown above to the file that comes up for editing.
Then, whenever you update your project, ``ez_setup`` will be updated as well.


Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.  It provides utility functions
for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of
writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions.  See the
documentation for more information on what is provided.

Six supports every Python version since 2.4.  It is contained in only one Python
file, so it can be easily copied into your project. (The copyright and license
notice must be retained.)

Online documentation is at http://pythonhosted.org/six/.

Bugs can be reported to http://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six.  The code can also be
found there.

-- Gregory P. Smith  greg@krypto.org

This Makefile works on most Unix platforms.  Although, by default, it
runs gcc, by setting the CC macro, it runs with many C compilers.

You can override the default build options by setting environment 
variables of the same name as the corresponding macro: DMALLOC,
SUPPORT_ACCESSIBILITY_CHECKS, SUPPORT_UTF16_ENCODINGS and
SUPPORT_ASIAN_ENCODINGS.  

$ DMALLOC=1 gmake

Note this Makefile will only run with gmake.  But you should be able
to easily locate a pre-built executable for your platform.

To customize the location of output files or install locations, just
edit the Makefile.  There are variable definitions for just about 
everything, so you shouldn't have to alter the build rules.

To use GNU "Auto" tools (AutoConf/AutoMake/LibTool), run
/bin/sh build/gnuauto/setup.sh from the top-level Tidy
directory.  This script will copy the appropriate 
Makefile.am files into each source directory, along with
configure.in.

If the script was successful you should now be able
to build in the usual way:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	$ make install

to get a list of configure options type: ./configure --help

Alternatively, you should be able to build outside of the source
tree. e.g.:

 	$ mkdir ../build-tidy
 	$ cd ../build-tidy
 	$ ../tidy/configure --prefix=/usr
 	$ make
 	$ make install


Tidy Build Files

Each subdirectory contains input files to a selected
build system for TidyLib and the command line driver.
Some build systems are cross-platform (gmake, autoconf),
others (msvc) are platform specific.  For details
on any given build system, see the readme file for
that system.

Directory  System                Comments
---------  --------------------  --------------------------
gmake      GNU Make              Used for "official" builds

gnuauto    GNU AutoConf          Supports shared lib builds

msvc       MS Visual C++ v6      Win32 only

rpm        Script for packages   For Linux distribution supporting rpm


Common Build Options

There are some basic build options for TidyLib, independent
of platform and build system.  Typically, these options can
be enabled or disabled by setting a macro value within the
Makefile or its equivalent.  An option may be disabled by
setting its value to "0".  Enable by setting to "1".  Again,
consult the directions for each build system for details
on how to enable/disable each option.

Option                        Default   Description
----------------------------  --------  ---------------------------------
DMALLOC                       Disabled  Use dmalloc for memory debugging
SUPPORT_ACCESSIBILITY_CHECKS  Enabled   Support W3C WAI checks
SUPPORT_UTF16_ENCODINGS       Enabled   Support Unicode documents
SUPPORT_ASIAN_ENCODINGS       Enabled   Support Big5 and ShiftJIS docs



# Script for Building tidy rpm packages


# To build the RPM packages for tidy on Redhat and other distros which support rpm.
# For making Debian packages, first create rpm package and then generate
# debian package by command "rpm2deb filename"



The steps are as follows:


1. Let's suppose TIDY_VERSION you are building is 02October2003


2. Unpack original source tree
        tar zxvf tidy_src.tgz
   This will extract to a directory called tidy


3. mv tidy tidy-02October2003
   Edit the tidy.spec file inside directory tidy-02October2003
   and make sure the Version variable is changed to 02October2003.
   Also edit the Makefile and change prefix to "exactly" say this:
        runinst_prefix=${RPMTMP}
        devinst_prefix=${RPMTMP}


4. tar zcvf tidy-02October2003.tgz tidy-02October2003


5. rpmbuild -ta tidy-02October2003.tgz


6. rm tidy-02October2003.tgz


7. To derive Debian package for tidy run command on created rpm packages
        rpm2deb tidy-02October2003-1.rpm


Watchdog
========
Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.


Example API Usage
-----------------
A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated::

    import sys
    import time
    import logging
    from watchdog.observers import Observer
    from watchdog.events import LoggingEventHandler

Shell Utilities
---------------
Watchdog comes with a utility script called ``watchmedo``.
Please type ``watchmedo --help`` at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.

Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to ``*.py`` and ``*.txt`` files while
ignoring all directory events::

    watchmedo log \
        --patterns="*.py;*.txt" \
        --ignore-directories \
        --recursive \
        .

You can use the ``shell-command`` subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events::

    watchmedo shell-command \
        --patterns="*.py;*.txt" \
        --recursive \
        --command='echo "${watch_src_path}"' \
        .

Please see the help information for these commands by typing::

    watchmedo [command] --help


About ``watchmedo`` Tricks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``watchmedo`` can read ``tricks.yaml`` files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass ``watchdog.tricks.Trick`` and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don't need.

An example ``tricks.yaml`` file::

    tricks:
    - watchdog.tricks.LoggerTrick:
        patterns: ["*.py", "*.js"]
    - watchmedo_webtricks.GoogleClosureTrick:
        patterns: ['*.js']
        hash_names: true
        mappings_format: json                  # json|yaml|python
        mappings_module: app/javascript_mappings
        suffix: .min.js
        compilation_level: advanced            # simple|advanced
        source_directory: app/static/js/
        destination_directory: app/public/js/
        files:
          index-page:
          - app/static/js/vendor/jquery*.js
          - app/static/js/base.js
          - app/static/js/index-page.js
          about-page:
          - app/static/js/vendor/jquery*.js
          - app/static/js/base.js
          - app/static/js/about-page/**/*.js

The directory containing the ``tricks.yaml`` file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the ``tricks.yaml`` file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.

Tricks will be included in the 0.5.0 release. I need community input about them.
Please file enhancement requests at the `issue tracker`_.


Installation
------------
Installing from PyPI using ``pip``::

    pip install watchdog

Installing from PyPI using ``easy_install``::

    easy_install watchdog

Installing from source::

    python setup.py install


Installation Caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``watchmedo`` script depends on PyYAML_ which links with LibYAML_,
which brings a performance boost to the PyYAML parser. However, installing
LibYAML_ is optional but recommended. On Mac OS X, you can use homebrew_
to install LibYAML::

    brew install libyaml

On Linux, use your favorite package manager to install LibYAML. Here's how you
do it on Ubuntu::

    sudo aptitude install libyaml-dev

On Windows, please install PyYAML_ using the binaries they provide.

Documentation
-------------
You can browse the latest release documentation_ online.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
* Linux 2.6 (inotify)
* Mac OS X (FSEvents, kqueue)
* FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue)
* Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
  ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads)
* OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
  periodically; slow and not recommended)

Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the 
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the 
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your ``~/.profile`` file and add
a line similar to::

    ulimit -n 1024

This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested 
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.

About using watchdog with editors like Vim
------------------------------------------
Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps it in to replace
the file you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim to avoid using swapfiles::

    set noswapfile

in your ``~/.vimrc`` should deal with this situation.


Dependencies
------------
1. Python 2.5 or above.
2. XCode_ (only on Mac OS X)
3. PyYAML_
4. argh_
5. select_backport_ (select.kqueue replacement for Python2.5/2.6 on BSD/Mac OS X)
6. pathtools_

==================
Cached descriptors
==================

Cached descriptors cache their output.  They take into account
instance attributes that they depend on, so when the instance
attributes change, the descriptors will change the values they
return.

Cached descriptors cache their data in _v_ attributes, so they are
also useful for managing the computation of volatile attributes for
persistent objects.

Persistent descriptors:

  property

     A simple computed property. See property.txt.

  method

     Idempotent method.  The return values are cached based on method
     arguments and on any instance attributes that the methods are
     defined to depend on.

     **Note**, only a cache based on arguments has been implemented so far.
     
     See method.txt.

patch.exe
=========
This is built from patch 2.6.1 with msys patches (plus one extra hack for mingw
instead of msys).  The upstream source is
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/patch-2.6.1-1-msys-1.0.13-src.tar.lzma
Compiled with mingw-w64 linux32->mingw32 cross compiler (automated nightly for
1.0 branch / gcc 4.5.3, 2011-03-25) with configure arguments
--host=i686-w64-mingw32 CFLAGS="-Os -s -mtune=core2"
CXXFLAGS="-Os -s -mtune=core2" LDFLAGS="-Wl,--enable-auto-import".

README for building a Mozilla for Komodo
========================================

This source tree provides for making builds of Mozilla -- primarily to
support Komodo. Basically it contains a number of patches to the Mozilla
sources and some build scripts that know how to checkout Mozilla from
CVS, apply the patches, and build.

For build instructions, please read the top-level "../README.txt".



# Komodo Edit

This readme explains how to get started building, using and developing with
the Komodo Edit source base.

Whilst the main Komodo Edit source is hosted under this repository you may also
want to check out the individual component/addon repositories under
https://github.com/Komodo in case you only want to contribute to a specific
component. This'll save you some time and hassle as you would not have to build
the entire project.

## Building Komodo

Note that these are simplified steps of the building process, for a more in-depth
guide check <BUILD.txt>.

### Building on Windows

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Building Steps](#building-steps)

#### Prerequisites

 * Python >=2.7 (but not Python 3.x yet). You can [install ActivePython from here](http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases).

 * Visual C++ 11.0 (aka Visual Studio 2012) and all the Platform SDKs for
   building Mozilla with vc11 [as described here](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Windows_Build_Prerequisites).
   
 * Install [the latest "MozillaBuild-$ver.exe"](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/) package into *the default dir*
   (i.e. "C:\mozilla-build").

 * Install the [latest ActivePerl](http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/).

See <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Windows_Build_Prerequisites> for
more details on Windows build prerequisites. However, following the above
steps is *meant to be sufficient* to get Komodo building.

#### Building Steps

 * Checkout Komodo Edit: `git clone https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit.git`

 * Using the command line, enter your checkout directory and run:

   ```
    cd mozilla
    setenv-moz-msvc11.bat
    python build.py configure -k 9.10
    python build.py distclean all
   ```

   This will configure and build mozilla and can take anywhere from 30 minutes
   to several hours to complete (depending on your specs). For most modern
   machines it should be about an hour.

 * After mozilla is built successfully go back to the main repo directory and
   build komodo:

   ```
    cd ..
    set PATH=util\black;%PATH%
    bk configure -V 8.10.0-devel
    bk build
   ```

   This should take significantly less time than building Mozilla.

 * Once the build has completed you can simply run Komodo by executing `bk run`
   
Upon making any modifications to the source you will again have to run `bk build`,
or simply `bk build && bk run` to quickly get back into Komodo. Subsequent builds
should be a lot faster as much of the compiled data is cached.

### Building on Mac & Linux

- [Mac Prerequisites](#mac-prerequisites)
- [Linux Prerequisites](#linux-prerequisites)
    - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)
    - [Fedora](#fedora)
    - [Others](#others)
- [Building Steps](#building-steps-1)

#### Mac Prerequisites

 * Python >=2.7 (but not Python 3.x yet). You can
   [install ActivePython from here](http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases).

   If you prefer the Python builds from python.org should be sufficient as well.

 * Xcode. [Install the latest one](http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/).

 * Xcode Command Line Tools.

   Open the Xcode preferences, then in the Downloads tab, select and install the
   Command Line Tools.

 * [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/). (Note: Fink may work too but most of the
   build testing and instructions is done with MacPorts.)

 * autoconf v2.13. Once you have MacPorts installed you need just run
   `sudo port install autoconf213`

 * ensure you are using clang or gcc 4.2 (or higher)

See <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mac_OS_X_Build_Prerequisites>
for more details on Mac OS X build prerequisites. However, following the
above steps is *meant to be sufficient* to get Komodo building.

#### Linux Prerequisites

##### Ubuntu

  `sudo apt-get build-dep firefox`

##### Fedora

  `sudo yum install gcc-c++ patch gtk2-devel libIDL-devel libcurl-devel`

##### Others

 * Python >=2.7 (but not Python 3.x yet). You can
   [install ActivePython from here](http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases).

   If you prefer, your distro's Python 2.7 should be sufficient.

 * Everything mentioned in the
   [Mozilla Linux build prerequisites](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Linux_Build_Prerequisites):

#### Building Steps

 * Checkout Komodo Edit: `git clone https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit.git`

 * Using the terminal, enter your checkout directory and run:

   ```
    cd komodo/mozilla
    python build.py configure -k 9.10
    python build.py distclean all
   ```

   This will configure and build mozilla and can take anywhere from 30 minutes
   to several hours to complete (depending on your specs). For most modern
   machines it should be about an hour.

 * After mozilla is built successfully go abck to the main repo directory and
   build komodo:

   ```
    cd ..
    export PATH=`pwd`/util/black:$PATH   # Komodo's "bk" build tool
    bk configure -V 9.10.0-devel
    bk build
   ```

   This should take significantly less time than building Mozilla.

 * Once the build has completed you can simply run Komodo by executing `bk run`

Upon making any modifications to the source you will again have to run `bk build`,
or simply `bk build && bk run` to quickly get back into Komodo. Subsequent builds
should be a lot faster as much of the compiled data is cached.

### Building Complications

If any errors occur during your first built-time and it is not obvious how to fix
the issue on your own please refer to the Feedback section on how to get in contact
with us.

Note that if building complications arise after you updated your repo with the latest
changes you might need to clear your local cache as it might be conflicting with the
new changes, to do this run `bk distclean` before running your build steps.

Photoshop-like Color Picker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Author:  John Dyer
License: MIT

This is a pure JavaScript PhotoShop-like color picker. The original author
of the code is "John Dyer", who posted the color picker and articles on his
website:
http://johndyer.name/post/2007/09/PhotoShop-like-JavaScript-Color-Picker.aspx

The color picker images are included in Komodo's "skin/images/colorpicker"
folder.

The original color picker code made use of Prototype (JavaScript library) for:
  1) Class.create syntax
  2) $() function
  3) Event.observe/stopObserving functionality
  4) positioning methods for the sliders

these Prototype methods were replaced with the equivalent pure JS functionality.

A simple XPCOM wrapper was created "xpcom_colorpicker.js" to provide the color
picker functionality through XPCOM.

The default Mozilla "colorpicker" element binding, which provides a swatch of
color buttons (50 or so colors) has been overriden to make use of this new
colorpicker dialog.

Komodo Notifications Plugin
===========================

This plugin provides a user notification service for Komodo.
Most of this document is out-of-date, but here's how to
add a notification with a button-callback:


var msg = <some message>
var options = {
    severity: Components.interfaces.koINotification.SEVERITY_INFO,
    details: msg };
var identifier = <some identifier>
var act = { label: <label>,
            identifier: <another identifier?? not really documented>,
            handler: function(notification, url) {
                  // callback code...
            }
};
options.actions = [act];
ko.notifications.add(msg, [<Category>], identifier, options);

I haven't bothered determining how much of the rest of this file
is still up-to-date.

Using the Notification Service
------------------------------

Examples:

1. Adding a notification

    var foo = new ko.notifications.Notification("My title", "My text");
    ko.notifications.add(foo);

A blue icon and the text "My title" should appear in the right-hand corner of
the statusbar. When you click it, the notifications list opens and shows the
notification you just added.

2. Adding a button

    var button = new ko.notifications.NotificationButton("Click me!", "c",
                                        function() {alert("rickroll'd!");});
    var bar = new ko.notifications.Notification("Other title", "more text",
                                                  null, null, [button]);
    ko.notifications.add(bar);

This notification has a button attached to it, that executes a callback when
you click it.

3. Adding a simple notification (shortcut)

    var notification = ko.notifications.notify('spam', 'eggs');

This creates a simple notification without any buttons, the title is 'spam'
and the text is 'eggs'. There are two more optional parameters for an icon url
and a priority.

4. Using from non-Chrome Javascript code

    Components.utils.import('resource://gre/notifications.js');
    NotifcationSvc.notify('monty', 'python');


GCC XML
=======

To run gccxml on sample.cxx:

- Run ..\setenv.bat if you haven't already.
- Run this::

    gccxml sample.cxx -fxml=sample.xml && cat sample.xml

- Run ``gccxml --help`` for lots of help output.



README for codeintel
====================


Building
--------

There are two ways to build and use the codeintel system.

1. Using it in the Komodo environment. Unless you are working directly on the
   guts of codeintel, this is for you. To build codeintel you just use the
   normal Komodo build system. See Komodo-devel/README.txt for details.

2. Independent codeintel usage: called a "local build". This is useful for
   playing with codeintel stuff outside of Komodo (for the test suite, for
   codeintel-specific development). For a local build, follow the
   instructions below.


Requirements for building:
- A C compiler. You need to one used to build your Python installation. If
  you are using Python 2.4 or later, than means you need VS.NET (aka VC 7).
  If you are using Python 2.3 or earlier, then you need VC6.
- A Python installation against which to build.
- Source for SilverCity and Scintilla in a source repository.
  If you can access crimper normally then the build script will go and get
  them from there automatically (typically from
  "\\crimper\apps\Komodo\support\codeintel").
- "patch" on your path
- Other little tools like:
    unzip
    tar


To build on Windows::

    bin\setenv.bat
    python Makefile.py all

To build on Un*x platforms::

    . bin/setenv.sh
    python Makefile.py all

If you need to update generated files
(if the Scintilla constants have changed,
for example), run

    python Makefile.py distclean all


Running the Test Suite
----------------------

Once you've setup your environment and made a local build of codeintel (see
above) you can run the test suite in the "test" subdirectory.

To run the whole test suite::

    cd test2
    python test.py

Individual test modules can be run::

    python test.py test_misc

Or directly:

    python test_misc.py

Some test modules provide additional scoping. For example "test_cile.py" is
responsible for testing all the CILEs (the CodeIntel Language Engines, i.e.
the language-specific scanners). Say you are working on just the Ruby CILE
and just want to run those tests::

    python test_cile.py Ruby
    python test_cile.py scan_inputs\resolve.rb

    
    python ci2.py test RHTMLTestCase -- Just RHTML
    python ci2.py test -- all tests


Updating udl-based lexers
-------------------------

    python Makefile.py distclean_udl_lexers udl_lexers
   

Troubleshooting
---------------

It just works! :)


Note that the patches here must be replicated in the XPCOM completion code, in
src/codeintel/src/komodo/xpcomJSElements.py.  This is necessary because it is
not possible to inherit from ciElementTree.Element, therefore an equivalent pure
Python version is needed.  See bug 99286.

README for codeintel javascript standard library CIX generation
===============================================================


Overview
--------

Todd found an XML file describing the JavaScript standard library. This xml
file (it is beleived) was generated from a website scrape... ahhh the hacks...
http://bluefish.clansco.org/ref/bflib_ECMAScript.xml

The XML file is translated using a XSL transformation (XSLT) to a codeintel
format and then it's tweaked by the python script to update certain elements.

Alternatives doc sources might be:

Dom
---

http://www.w3.org/DOM/

DOM Level 0
===========

This is generally what the host environment (browser) defines to support
the Javascript DOM environment. This is not actually a specification, but each
browser (firefox, ie, opera...) generally supplies the same functions. I.e.

* window (global object, does not need to be prefixed)
* window.document (information about the current page)
* window.navigator (which contains userAgent, plugins, javaEnabled, etc...)

DOM Level 1
===========

First specification of the DOM, used by some older programs and browsers.

http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR#dom1

DOM Level 2
===========

Second specification of the DOM, supported and used by most browsers today.

http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR#dom2

DOM Level 3
===========

Third specification of the DOM, this is mostly still a working draft, and as
such there is not a lot of support for DOM Level 3 as yet.

http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR#dom3


Requirements for building
-------------------------

The following python modules are required:

* libxml2
* libxslt
* elementtree (or cElementTree)
* BeautifulSoup

== Welcome to Rails

Rails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything
needed to create database-backed web-applications according to the
Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also
called the presentation) into "dumb" templates that are primarily responsible
for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the
"smart" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all
the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The
controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update
Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.

In Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping
layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from
database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic
methods. You can read more about Active Record in 
link:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.

The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers
are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is
unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much
more separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of
Rails.  You can read more about Action Pack in 
link:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.


== Getting started

1. Start the web server: <tt>ruby script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get "Welcome aboard: Youre riding the Rails!"
3. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application


== Web servers

Rails uses the built-in web server in Ruby called WEBrick by default, so you don't
have to install or configure anything to play around. 

If you have lighttpd installed, though, it'll be used instead when running script/server.
It's considerably faster than WEBrick and suited for production use, but requires additional
installation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged
to start with WEBrick). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from
http://www.lighttpd.net.

If you want something that's halfway between WEBrick and lighttpd, we heartily recommend
Mongrel. It's a Ruby-based web server with a C-component (so it requires compilation) that
also works very well with Windows. See more at http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/.

But of course its also possible to run Rails with the premiere open source web server Apache.
To get decent performance, though, you'll need to install FastCGI. For Apache 1.3, you want
to use mod_fastcgi. For Apache 2.0+, you want to use mod_fcgid.

See http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI for more information on FastCGI.

== Example for Apache conf

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName rails
    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/
    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log
  
    <Directory /path/application/public/>
      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride all
      Allow from all
      Order allow,deny
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

NOTE: Be sure that CGIs can be executed in that directory as well. So ExecCGI
should be on and ".cgi" should respond. All requests from 127.0.0.1 go
through CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes. All other requests
go through FCGI (or mod_ruby), which requires a restart to show changes.


== Debugging Rails

Have "tail -f" commands running on both the server.log, production.log, and
test.log files. Rails will automatically display debugging and runtime
information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the browser
on requests from 127.0.0.1.


== Breakpoints

Breakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client. This
means that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate
and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:

  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find_all
      breakpoint "Breaking out from the list"
    end
  end
  
So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you
with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things like:

Executing breakpoint "Breaking out from the list" at .../webrick_server.rb:16 in 'breakpoint'

  >> @posts.inspect
  => "[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>, 
       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\"title\"=>\"Rails you know!\", \"body\"=>\"Only ten..\", \"id\"=>\"2\"}>]"
  >> @posts.first.title = "hello from a breakpoint"
  => "hello from a breakpoint"

...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:

  >> f = @posts.first 
  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={"title"=>nil, "body"=>nil, "id"=>"1"}>
  >> f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)

Finally, when you're ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D


== Console

You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through script/console. 
Here you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the
application is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the
database. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.

To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>



== Description of contents

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblog_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
  ActionController::Base.

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.
  
app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblog/index.rhtml for the WeblogController#index action. All views use eRuby
  syntax. This directory can also be used to keep stylesheets, images, and so on
  that can be symlinked to public.
  
app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblog_helper.rb.

app/apis
  Holds API classes for web services.

config
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.

components
  Self-contained mini-applications that can bundle together controllers, models, and views.

db
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all
  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.

lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't
  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.
    
public
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,
  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files.

script
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.

test
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures.

vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.
  This directory is in the load path.

The FamFamFam Silk icon set is a very large,
consistent set of well-drawn icons that has
proven to be popular with both applications
and web sites.

On a number of occasions I have found myself
wanting more icons in the same style. This 
companion set represents what I needed but also
what I felt like adding.

Some are new icons in the same style, some are
alternative sizes/colours of the existing icons
and some are new compositions of the elements.

Any questions about this companion set please
contact damieng@gmail.com.

rmtreew.exe: A "subsystem:windows" program to recursively remove a directory
to be used as an MSI custom action (for Komodo uninstall).


aswixui -- ActiveState WiX UI library
=====================================

'aswixui' is a branch of the WiX project's UI library for defining an MSI
installer user interface. The original WiX sources are kept in:

    //depot/main/contrib/wix/...

with the "wixui" bits found in ".../src/ui/wixui". That tree is branched
here:

    p4 integrate //depot/main/contrib/wix/src/ui/wixui/... \
        //depot/main/support/aswixui/...

and some modifications are maintained to somewhat customize the UI for use
for MSI installers for some ActiveState products.

Currently there are not that many changes; and I don't expect there to be.


WiX Introduction
================

WiX is an XML schema and a set of tools for defining an MSI project and
building it. To effectively use WiX you have to know quite a lot about MSI
itself. Teaching that is out of scope here.  More details:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/

This is currently the best tutorial I know for learning how to use WiX:

    http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/index.html


Building 'aswixui'
==================

At the time of this writing there are three flavours of the WiX UI that
define a slightly different UI for an MSI. Currently only the "Feature Tree"
flavour is being used (currently only by Komodo), so this is the only WiX UI
library that is built.

To build the ActiveState WiX UI library (aswixui_featuretree.wixlib):

1. Install the latest WiX toolset:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105970&package_id=114109

   (Typically I install it to "C:\Program Files\Wix".)

2. Put it on your PATH. You should be able to run "candle" at the command
   line.

3. Get "nmake" on your PATH from somewhere. Visual Studio (any version)
   and Platform SDK both supply an "nmake.exe".

4. Build it:

    nmake


Using 'aswixui_featuretree.wixlib'
==================================

The way you use your WiX UI library is as follows:

1. Refer to the exported UI id in your normal WiX project source file (.wxs):

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <Wix xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/wi">
          <Product ...>
          ...
            <UIRef Id="WixUI" />
          ...
          </Product>
 
2. Link in the library when you build your files:

        candle *.wxs
        light -out foo.msi *.wixobj ...\aswixui_featuretree.wixlib




This directory contains the custom actions we use for Komodo's WiX installer.
README for Komodo's WiX usage
=============================

This directory holds the WiX project files for building the Komodo Windows
installer. WiX is an open source tool (see sf.net) for building .msi files
from an XML definition. This is MSI so this is complicated.


What to do when I add/remove a file to/from Komodo
--------------------------------------------------

These WiX project files need to know the exact Komodo file manifest. I.e. if
a file is added or removed from the Komodo install tree then something in
here needs to be updated. If not the Windows build will fail.

When the build does fail a tool (bin/wax.py) is run against the current
project files and the Komodo install image to determine what changes need to
hand-integrated into the project files. That helps, but that takes time (a
Window build currently takes 45 min) so this is a 1.5 hour cycle at least. In
some circumstances you can help out by making the WiX changes ahead of time
(ideally with the same change that you add/remove files from Komodo). Here is
how.

*Note*: You don't have to be on Windows to do the following.

1. Are you adding or removing a *directory*? If so, then give up. This is hard
   enough that we should just allow the build to fail and generate that diff
   file with wax.py.

2. Resist the temptation to manually do the update without running
   'bin/newstuff.py' in step (4). There are a few subtleties involved in
   getting all the Wix attributes just right.

3. Is the file part of the "docs" or "core" feature? This tells you if you
   are editing "feature-docs.wxs.in" or "feature-core.wxs.in".

4. Removing a file: Find the <File> node for your file (just search for the
   basename and make sure the "src" attribute is the right one). Delete
   that line (i.e. the whole <File/> tag).

   Adding a file: Find the appropriate <Directory> node in the .wxs file
   (i.e. look for the <File> nodes for other files in the same directory).
   Duplicate one of the <File> lines from the same directory and edit it
   to look like this:

my_getopt - a command-line argument parser
Copyright 1997-2002, Benjamin Sittler

The author can be reached by sending email to <bsittler@iname.com>.

The version of my_getopt in this package (1.4) has a BSD-like license;
see the file LICENSE for details. Version 1.0 of my_getopt was similar
to the GPL'ed version of my_getopt included with SMOKE-16 Version 1,
Release 19990717. SMOKE-16 packages are available from:

OVERVIEW OF THE ARGUMENT PARSER
===============================

The getopt(), getopt_long() and getopt_long_only() functions parse
command line arguments. The argc and argv parameters passed to these
functions correspond to the argument count and argument list passed to
your program's main() function at program start-up. Element 0 of the
argument list conventionally contains the name of your program. Any
remaining arguments starting with "-" (except for "-" or "--" by
themselves) are option arguments, some of include option values. This
family of getopt() functions allows intermixed option and non-option
arguments anywhere in the argument list, except that "--" by itself
causes the remaining elements of the argument list to be treated as
non-option arguments.

  "WHY RE-INVENT THE WHEEL?" for a more information. ]

FILES
=====

The following four files constitute the my_getopt package:

 LICENSE         - license and warranty information for my_getopt
 my_getopt.c     - implementation of my getopt replacement
 my_getopt.h     - interface for my getopt replacement
 getopt.h        - a header file to make my getopt look like GNU getopt

USAGE
=====

To use my_getopt in your application, include the following line to
your main program source:

 #include "getopt.h"

This line should appear after your standard system header files to
avoid conflicting with your system's built-in getopt.

Then compile my_getopt.c into my_getopt.o, and link my_getopt.o into
your application:

 $ cc -c my_getopt.c
 $ ld -o app app.o ... my_getopt.o

To avoid conflicting with standard library functions, the function
names and global variables used by my_getopt all begin with `my_'. To
ensure compatibility with existing C programs, the `getopt.h' header
file uses the C preprocessor to redefine names like getopt, optarg,
optind, and so forth to my_getopt, my_optarg, my_optind, etc.

SAMPLE PROGRAM
==============

There is also a public-domain sample program:

 main.c          - main() for a sample program using my_getopt
 Makefile        - build script for the sample program (called `copy')

To build and test the sample program:

 $ make
 $ ./copy -help
 $ ./copy -version

The sample program bears a slight resemblance to the UNIX `cat'
utility, but can be used rot13-encode streams, and can redirect output
to a file.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

There is not yet any real documentation for my_getopt. For the moment,
use the Linux manual page for getopt. It has its own copyright and
license; view the file `getopt.3' in a text editor for more details.

 getopt.3        - the manual page for GNU getopt
 getopt.txt      - preformatted copy of the manual page for GNU getopt,
                   for your convenience

WHY RE-INVENT THE WHEEL?
========================

I re-implemented getopt, getopt_long, and getopt_long_only because
there were noticable bugs in several versions of the GNU
implementations, and because the GNU versions aren't always available
on some systems (*BSD, for example.) Other systems don't include any
sort of standard argument parser (Win32 with Microsoft tools, for
example, has no getopt.)

These should do all the expected Unix- and GNU-style argument
parsing, including permution, bunching, long options with single or
double dashes (double dashes are required if you use
my_getopt_long,) and optional arguments for both long and short
options. A word with double dashes all by themselves halts argument
parsing. A required long option argument can be in the same word as
the option name, separated by '=', or in the next word. An optional
long option argument must be in the same word as the option name,
separated by '='.

As with the GNU versions, a '+' prefix to the short option
specification (or the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable) disables
permution, a '-' prefix to the short option specification returns 1
for non-options, ':' after a short option indicates a required
argument, and '::' after a short option specification indicates an
optional argument (which must appear in the same word.) If you'd like
to recieve ':' instead of '?' for missing option arguments, prefix the
short option specification with ':'.

The original intent was to re-implement the documented behavior of
the GNU versions, but I have found it necessary to emulate some of
the undocumented behavior as well. Some programs depend on it.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

The GNU versions support POSIX-style -W "name=value" long
options. Currently, my_getopt does not support these, because I
don't have any documentation on them (other than the fact that they
are enabled by "W;" in the short option specification.) As a
temporary workaround, my_getopt treats "W;" in the short option
string identically to "W:".

The GNU versions support internationalized/localized
messages. Currently, my_getopt does not.

There should be re-entrant versions of all these functions so that
multiple threads can parse arguments simultaneously.

Building Abyss
==============

To build Abyss please refer to the documentation on building an extension:

http://community.activestate.com/forum/introduction-building-komodo-extension

Note that Komodo skins need to be built using the --unjarred flag, ie.

  koext build --unjarred

Once you have built and installed your own version of Abyss you can activate it
under Preferences > Appearance > Skin.

Note that if you were already using the version of Abyss provided with Komodo
you will need to switch back and forth between another skin in order to apply
your own version of Abyss.

README for UDL (User Defined Languages)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UDL provides a system for multilanguage syntax lexing in Komodo (and for
user-defined syntax highlighting). "Luddite" is the name of a tool for
compiling lexer definition files (.udl files) to the resources that Komodo
needs to use them. Luddite also provides functionality for package these
resources into a Komodo extension and for install that.



Installation
============

1. To install luddite you first need a Python installation (minimum version
   2.3). If you do not have that, you can get the latest ActivePython from
   here::

        http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/

2. Unzip the luddite source package::

        unzip luddite.zip       # Windows
        tar xzf luddite.tar.gz  # Linux, Mac OS X

3. Install luddite into your Python::

        cd luddite-$VERSION
        python setup.py install

4. Ensure luddite is on your PATH and working. The following command should
   print luddite's main help.

        luddite

   If that worked, then you are done with installation. If not, then read the
   `Installation Troubleshooting`_ section below.



Overview of adding a custom language for Komodo
===============================================

The basic usage of luddite to add a custom language to Komodo is as follows:

1. Write the lexer definition: one or more .udl files. Resources for writing
   UDL files include:
   
   - using `udl/*.udl` as examples
   - `the spec <http://specs.tl.activestate.com/kd/kd-0149.html>`_
   - Eric's blogged `UDL tutorial adding Kid as a Komodo language
     <http://blogs.activestate.com/ericp/2007/01/kid_adding_a_ne.html>`_

   There currently is no real user documentation.

2. Compile the lexer::

    python luddite.py help compile
    python luddite.py compile UDL_PATH

3. Build a Komodo extension with the built resources::

    python luddite.py help package
    python luddite.py package LANG

4. Install that extension in your Komodo. You can do this either by opening
   that extension (FOO.xpi) in Komodo or via::

    python luddite.py install LANG


Note: The luddite.py script requires a zip executable in the path.
Info-Zip, a free implementation of zip for Windows can be found here:

  http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html#Win32


Installation Troubleshooting
============================


Windows. `python setup.py install` worked, but running `luddite` does not work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem might be one of two things. Either (a) you do not have ".py" on
your PATHEXT environment variable or, more likely, (b) you do not have
Python's "Scripts" directory on your PATH.

(a) If you do not have ".py" on your PATHEXT environment variable, then
Windows does not know to look for `luddite.py` when you try to run
`luddite`. Try running::

    luddite.py

or add ".py" to your PATHEXT. For example::

    set PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.py

Note: To change PATHEXT permanently your will need to make the change in
your Windows' System Properties dialog box:

- right-click on "My Computer" and select "Properties"
- click the "Advanced" tab
- click "Environment Variables"
- edit the PATHEXT environment variable

(b) On Windows, Python *scripts* installed with 'setup.py' are installed to
a "Scripts" subdirectory of your Python installation. For example::

    C:\Python24\Scripts\luddite.py

Typically this directory is *not* automatically on your PATH. You will
either need to manually put it on your PATH or manually specify the full
path to run 'luddite', e.g.::

    python C:\Python24\Scripts\luddite.py


My install on Linux fails with "error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The install instructions for many of the Python packages on trentm.com have you run::

    python setup.py install

This has been known to fail on some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) when
using the system Python (/usr/bin/python)::

    $ /usr/bin/python setup.py install
    running install
    error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)

``setup.py`` is a Python setup script using Python's standard `distutils
system`_. To install a Python module it needs to use the Makefile with which
Python was built. This is typically in a Linux distro's Python development
package -- which may not be installed by default.

On Ubuntu, if you get this failure, you need to install the "python-dev"
package::

    sudo apt-get install python-dev


.. _distutils system: http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html



Internal build maintenance
==========================

- 'ludditelib/constants.py' is generated from 'LexUDL.cxx' and
  'Scintilla.iface'. If those update significantly then 'gen_constants.py'
  should be run as per its docstring.


This directory contains mock implementations of various ko.* things; they can
be used by importing:

  var ko = {};
  // The following line imports ko.views and ko.stringutils
  Components.utils.import("resource://komodo-jstest/mock/mock.jsm", {}).import(ko, "views", "stringutils");

This directory holds some simple code to test JS code.

It looks through the source tree for files named like "test_*.jsm".  For each
file found, it will:

- import the file from JS;
- look for an array named "JS_TESTS" (which should contain strings);
- for each element in the array, try to look up the class named by the string;
- for each class found, try to run it as a TestCase.

Each test case should inherit from TestCase in resource://komodo-jstest/JSTest.jsm;
it may have "setUp", "tearDown", and various "test_*" methods.  The various
assertion functions are available, e.g. assertTrue.

Test suites are currently not supported.

Any uncaught exceptions will be reported as failures.

This is the test suite for process.py. A prerequisite for the test suite
is to build some test executables:

    nmake -f Makefile.win32         # on Windows
    make -f Makefile.linux          # on Linux, Mac OS X
    make -f Makefile.solaris        # on Solaris

The you can run the test suite:

        python test.py

At the time of this writing (Jan 2008) this is NOT integrated with Komodo's
general "bk test" full test suite. As well, a number of tests have been
broken with the significant changes made to process.py to be based on Python
2.5's subprocess module instead of using PyWin32. These need to be
investigated. -- Trent


README for the Komodo test suite
================================

Note: "bk test" is just a shortcut for (1) running `test.py` in this
directory and (2) doing so with your configured mozilla environment -- i.e.
your `bkconfig.py`.


A "bk test" primer
------------------

	$ bk test

This runs the whole Komodo test suite (such as it is). Note that there are
many test-y things spread around Komodo, but the "test suite" that I'm
talking about here is stuff under the "test" directory.

As of right now: no running Komodo, no Casper, no GUI. However, PyXPCOM tests
run outside of Komodo *are* supported.


	$ bk test foo bar baz

Those are *tags* used to (1) filter the set of test files run and (2) are
also passed to those tests so they can sub-filter based on the tags. Some
examples:

	$ bk test ci            # run all CodeIntel tests
	$ bk test runcommand    # run all run-command system tests
	$ bk test -- -ci        # run everything *except* CodeIntel tests

(Note that to use the "-foo" trick you need to explicitly stop option
processing with the "--".)

You can use multiple tags:

	$ bk test ci python     # run just the Python-related CodeIntel tests

Full glorious details:

	$ bk test -h



How do I add new tests?
-----------------------

To add a new test you generally need to add or extend a "test_*.py" module in
the appropriate place. The test suite is based upon Python's unittest.py
module. Some knowledge of unittest is useful
(http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html).

If your test cases use PyXPCOM modules, then add a module under
"test/pyxpcom/...". If your tests cases just test a pure-Python system in
Komodo, add a module in the "test" dir.  To add tests to the CodeIntel
system, see the "src/codeintel/test2/..." directory.

If you have difficulties adding a new test, please ask on the OpenKomodo
development list:

    http://lists.openkomodo.com/mailman/listinfo/openkomodo-dev



This dir holds sample files for testing stuff (mostly perf) in Komodo.

- 'elf-linux' is the first 1024 bytes of a Linux ELF executable
- 'mach-o' is the first 1024 bytes of a (non-universal) Mach-O executable
- 'mach-o-universal' is the first 1024 bytes of a universal Mach-O executable


The Black build tool.

Installation:

    - unpack the file into some directory
    - put that directory on your PATH
    - on windows: compile bk.cpp -> bk.exe via "nmake -f makefile.win"

Usage:

    - see the test/... files, they give some starter examples
    - The command line interface to black is "bk ...". Just type "bk help" to
      get an introduction.
    - "bk" operates on a Blackfile, which denotes a project root.
      The Blackfile on which to operate is determined as follows:
       1. If "-f <blackfile>" is specified, that is used.
       2. Else if a Blackfile.py is found in an ancestral directory, then
          that is used.
       3. Else if the BLACKFILE_FALLBACK environment variable is defined,
          then that is used.
      See "test/test_findblackfile.py" for test cases.



instructions for using DTD validator

1. get xmlproc and install it.  scripts must be accessable somewhere, I just dropped them in komodo-devel/dtd
  <URL: http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/software/xmlproc/ >

2. import the dtdvalidator project

3. xul files need:

<!DOCTYPE window PUBLIC "-//MOZILLA//DTD XUL V1.0//EN" "http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul">


If the xul uses a dtd for entity references, do this:

<!DOCTYPE window PUBLIC "-//MOZILLA//DTD XUL V1.0//EN" "http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul" [
    <!ENTITY % viewprefsDTD SYSTEM "chrome://komodo/locale/editor/currentViewPrefs.dtd">
        %viewprefsDTD;
    <!ENTITY % prefIndentDTD SYSTEM "chrome://komodo/locale/pref/pref-indentation.dtd">
        %prefIndentDTD;
    <!ENTITY % prefEditsmartDTD SYSTEM "chrome://komodo/locale/pref/pref-editsmart.dtd">
        %prefEditsmartDTD;    
]>

Note, xmlproc doesn't handle chrome url's, so will error on any entity references.

4. xbl files need:

<!DOCTYPE bindings PUBLIC "-//MOZILLA//DTD XBL V1.0//EN" "http://www.mozilla.org/xbl">
