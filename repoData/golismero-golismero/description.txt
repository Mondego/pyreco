Import plugins go here. These plugins are the ones that import the results from external tools into the GoLismero database right before starting an audit.
All of the GoLismero plugins go here.
Report plugins go here. These plugins are the ones that export the results from the GoLismero database to the output files.
These plugins implement the vulnerability exploitation (intrusive) phase of GoLismero.
These plugins clean up after a GoLismero scan.
These plugins implement the post-exploitation phase of GoLismero.
Testing plugins go here. These plugins run the actual security tests against the targets.

They are divided into two subcategories: discovery (the information gathering phase) and attack (the vulnerability assessment phase).
These plugins implement the reconaissance phase of GoLismero.
# How to use OpenVAS correlation

To use OpenVAS correlation you must setup the plugin first. Follow these steps:

## 1 - Download OpenVAS plugins

You need the OpenVAS plugins feed. You can download it from [http://www.openvas.org/openvas-nvt-feed-current.tar.bz2](http://www.openvas.org/openvas-nvt-feed-current.tar.bz2) or get it from your OpenVAS installation.

## 2 - Generate database

Now we need to generate the database. To do that, you must run:

```python setup.py -p YOUR_PLUGIN_LOCATION -v```

## 3 - Done

Now we have a pickled database called: **openvas.db**

# How does it work?

OpenVAS generator produces a rules file. This file contains the expressions to find and correlate OpenVAS plugins with the GoLismero data model.

The setup.py script will search in the specified directory and load all files called "rules_*json", containing the rules.

# Available types of vulnerabilities

Each vulnerability has its type, in order to be classified by the OpenVAS plugin. Available types are:

 * platform
 * software
 * webapp
 * malware
 * http

# Rules format

## Rules file format

Rule files have the following JSON format:

 * comment: A comment about the rule.
 * rule_id: Unique identification of the rule.
 * rule_type: Category of the rule (one of the types listed above).
 * matching_types: Classes types, in GoLismero data model, that matches with this rule.
 * filename_rules: Rules applied to the file name only.
 * content_rules: Rules applied to the file content only.

## Rule details

Each rule (in section filename_rules and content_rules) has this format:

### Structure:

 * Each section is formed by a group of rules and can have more than one group.
 * Each group can have more han one rule.

### Rule specification:

Each rule has 3 parameters: 

 * regex: String. Defines how the rule is matched. The value can be:
   * Regular expression: Rule will match if this regex matches.
   * Reference: If a reference is specified instead, the rule matches if the reference matches with all "rules_types" or a concrete "rule_id". References start with the prefix: "REF://".
 * group: Integer or "\*". A regex can have more than one group. The rule matches if the regex has this number of groups. If "\*" is specified, any number of groups will match.
 * operator: Boolean operator. Specify the relation to the next rule (in rule group). Allowed operators are:
   * or: If this rule matches, the rule group is accepted. If not, it try to match the next rule. Default value if not specified.
   * and: If this rule matches, try to match the next rule. If not, the rule group is not accepted.
 * negate: Boolean. If set to "true", the above logic for accepting the rule is inverted.


These plugins implement the vulnerability scanning (non-intrusive) phase of GoLismero.
UI plugins go here. These plugins provide the user interface to GoLismero. This is an internally used kind of plugin, users normally don't need to add anything here.
What's GoLismero?
=================

GoLismero is an open source framework for security testing. It's currently geared towards web security, but it can easily be expanded to other kinds of scans.

The most interesting features of the framework are:

- Real platform independence. Tested on Windows, Linux, *BSD and OS X.
- No native library dependencies. All of the framework has been written in pure Python.
- Good performance when compared with other frameworks written in Python and other scripting languages.
- Very easy to use.
- Plugin development is extremely simple.
- The framework also collects and unifies the results of well known tools: sqlmap, xsser, openvas, dnsrecon, theharvester...
- Integration with standards: CWE, CVE and OWASP.
- Designed for cluster deployment in mind (not available yet).

Installing
==========

Strictly speaking, GoLismero doesn't require installation - only its dependencies do. So if you want to use it on a system where you don't have root privileges, you can ask the system administrator to install them for you, and just run the "git checkout" command on your home folder.

The following are step-by-step instructions to install GoLismero on different operating systems:

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

The following commands will download and install GoLismero on your system. This requires root privileges, so you will be prompted for your password when you run the first command.

```
sudo bash
apt-get install python2.7 python2.7-dev python-pip python-docutils git perl nmap sslscan
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/golismero/golismero.git
cd golismero
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_unix.txt
ln -s /opt/golismero/golismero.py /usr/bin/golismero
exit
```

If you have an API key for Shodan, or an OpenVAS server or SpiderFoot server you want to integrate with GoLismero, run the following commands:

```
mkdir ~/.golismero
touch ~/.golismero/user.conf
chmod 600 ~/.golismero/user.conf
nano ~/.golismero/user.conf
```

At the editor, add the following sections to the file, as appropriate:

```
[shodan:Configuration]
apikey = <INSERT YOUR SHODAN API KEY HERE>

[openvas]
host = <INSERT THE OPENVAS HOST HERE>
user = <INSERT THE OPENVAS USERNAME HERE>
*password = <INSERT THE OPENVAS PASSWORD HERE>

[spiderfoot]
url = <INSERT THE SPIDERFOOT URL HERE>
```

Mac OS X
--------

First of all, on Mac we'll need to install the [Mac Ports](http://www.macports.org/install.php).

After doing that, run the following commands to download and install GoLismero on your system. This requires root privileges, so you will be prompted for your password when you run the first command.

```
sudo -s
easy_install-2.7 -U distribute
easy_install install pip
port install nmap sslscan
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/golismero/golismero.git
cd golismero
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_unix.txt
ln -s /opt/golismero/golismero.py /usr/bin/golismero
exit
```

If you have an API key for Shodan, or an OpenVAS server or SpiderFoot server you want to integrate with GoLismero, run the following commands:

```
mkdir ~/.golismero
touch ~/.golismero/user.conf
chmod 600 ~/.golismero/user.conf
nano ~/.golismero/user.conf
```

At the editor, add the following sections to the file, as appropriate:

```
[shodan:Configuration]
apikey = <INSERT YOUR SHODAN API KEY HERE>

[openvas]
host = <INSERT THE OPENVAS HOST HERE>
user = <INSERT THE OPENVAS USERNAME HERE>
*password = <INSERT THE OPENVAS PASSWORD HERE>

[spiderfoot]
url = <INSERT THE SPIDERFOOT URL HERE>
```

FreeBSD 10-Release
------------------

The following commands will download and install GoLismero on your system. This requires root privileges, so you will be prompted for your password when you run the first command.

```
su -
cd /root
pkg update
pkg install git
pkg install python27
ln -s /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python
pkg install databases/py-sqlite3
pkg install nmap
pkg install sslscan
pkg install devel/py-pip
mkdir /opt 2> /dev/null
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/golismero/golismero.git
cd golismero
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_unix.txt
ln -s /opt/golismero/golismero.py /usr/bin/golismero
exit
```

If you have an API key for Shodan, or an OpenVAS server or SpiderFoot server you want to integrate with GoLismero, run the following commands:

```
mkdir ~/.golismero
touch ~/.golismero/user.conf
chmod 600 ~/.golismero/user.conf
nano ~/.golismero/user.conf
```

At the editor, add the following sections to the file, as appropriate:

```
[shodan:Configuration]
apikey = <INSERT YOUR SHODAN API KEY HERE>

[openvas]
host = <INSERT THE OPENVAS HOST HERE>
user = <INSERT THE OPENVAS USERNAME HERE>
*password = <INSERT THE OPENVAS PASSWORD HERE>

[spiderfoot]
url = <INSERT THE SPIDERFOOT URL HERE>
```

Windows
-------

On Windows, you'll have to install each tool separately. You can download them from here:
- [Python 2.7](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/)
- [Git](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list)
- [Perl](http://www.perl.org/get.html#win32)
- [Nmap](http://nmap.org/download.html#windows)
- [SSLScan](https://code.google.com/p/sslscan-win/)

SSLScan for Windows has a bug that causes crashes when writing XML output, which is the one required by GoLismero. The issue has been [unfixed since 2010](https://code.google.com/p/sslscan-win/issues/detail?id=2), so it's not likely to change soon, but there's a workaround: simply upgrade OpenSSL to a newer version. You can get an OpenSSL build from here: [Win32OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

It's usually a good idea to install Visual Studio 2008 SP1 as well. This enables the compilation of C extensions, which can speed up some Python modules.

After installing the tools, open a console and run the following commands:

```
cd %HOME%
git clone https://github.com/golismero/golismero.git
cd golismero
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you may have to add the tools to the PATH environment variable so GoLismero can find them. You can also add GoLismero itself to the PATH.

If you have an API key for Shodan, or an OpenVAS server or SpiderFoot server you want to integrate with GoLismero, create a new file called "user.conf" where you installed GoLismero and add the following sections to the file, as appropriate:

```
[shodan:Configuration]
apikey = <INSERT YOUR SHODAN API KEY HERE>

[openvas]
host = <INSERT THE OPENVAS HOST HERE>
user = <INSERT THE OPENVAS USERNAME HERE>
*password = <INSERT THE OPENVAS PASSWORD HERE>

[spiderfoot]
url = <INSERT THE SPIDERFOOT URL HERE>
```

Quick help
==========

Using GoLismero is very easy. Below are some basic commands to start to using it:

Basic usage
-----------

This command will launch GoLismero with all default options and show the report on standard output:

```golismero scan <target>```

If you omit the default command "scan" GoLismero is smart enough to figure out what you're trying to do, so this works too:

```golismero <target>```

You can also set a name for your audit with --audit-name:

```golismero scan <target> --audit-name <name>```

And you can produce reports in different file formats. The format is guessed from the file extension, and you can write as many files as you want:

```golismero scan <target> -o <output file name>```

![Run example](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/run_mac.png "Run example")

Additionally, you can import results from other tools with the -i option. You can use -i several times to import multiple files.

```golismero import nikto_output.csv nmap_output.xml -db database.db```

All results are automatically stored in a database file. You can prevent this with the -nd option:

```golismero <target> -nd```

![No database example](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/no_db_mint.png "No database example")

This allows you to scan the target in one step, and generating the report later. For example, to scan without generating a report:

```golismero scan <target> -db database.db -no```

And then generate the report from the database at a later time (or from a different machine!):

```golismero report report.html -db database.db```

You can also specify multiple output files:

```golismero report report.html report.txt report.rst -db example.db```

![Report example](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/report_win.png "Report example")

Available plugins
-----------------

To display the list of available plugins:

```golismero plugins```

![Plugin list example](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/plugin_list_mac.png "Plugin list example")

You can also query more information about specific plugins:

```golismero info <plugin>```

![Plugin info example](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/plugin_info_mint.png "Plugin list example")

The full plugin list is also available [online](http://golismero-project.com/doc/plugin_list/index.html).

Select a specific plugin
------------------------

Use the -e option to enable only some specific plugins, and -d to disable plugins (you can use -e and -d many times):

```golismero scan <target> -e <plugin>```

You can also select multiple plugins using wildcards. For example, you can select all bruteforce plugins like this:

```golismero scan <target> -e brute*```

![Run plugin example](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/run_plugin_mac_2.png "Run plugin example")

Reporting and eye candy
-----------------------

GoLismero currently produces reports on the console, in plain text files, in reStructured text format and in HTML format. In all cases, the reports are self-contained in a single file for easier transport - that means the HTML report is a single .html file with everything bundled in, and you can just attach it in an email to send it to someone else.

If no output files are specified, GoLismero reports on the console by default. But you can choose both at the same time too! For example, let's write an HTML report and also see the output on the console, using the special filename "-":

```golismero scan <target> -o - -o report.html```

Here's what the HTML report summary looks like on Chrome:

![Report header](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/report_chrome_header.png "Report header")

The table of contents, on Firefox:

![Report table](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/report_firefox_header.png "Report table")

And the details for each vulnerability, on Internet Explorer:

![Report details](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/report_ie_detail.png "Report details")

It's also compatible with mobile devices, like for example an iPad:

![Report summary on iPad](https://raw.github.com/golismero/golismero/master/doc/screenshots/report_ipad.png "Report summary on iPad")

As you surely noticed, the layout remains consistent across all platforms. The HTML report is completely self contained in a single .html file, making it very easy to share.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

In this example we'll put everything we've seen above into practice in a single command. We'll import results from an Nmap scan, run a scan of our own but using only the DNS analysis plugins, save the results in a database file of our choosing and produce reports in HTML and reStructured text format.

```golismero -i nmap_output.xml -e dns* -db database.db -o report.rst -o report.html```

Notice how the default "scan" command was omitted but GoLismero figured it out on its own.

This is how you'd do it if you want to break it into multiple commands instead:

```
golismero import -db database.db nmap_output.xml
golismero scan -db database.db -e dns* -no
golismero report -db database.db report.rst report.html
```

Notice how the second command uses the "-no" switch to prevent the default console report from kicking in.

What will be the next features?
===============================

The next features of GoLismero will be:

- Integration with Metasploit, w3af, ZAP and many other free tools.
- Web UI. We all know true h4xx0rs only use the console, but sometimes drag&drop does come in handy. ;)
- Export results in PDF and MS Word format, to keep the boss happy.
- And more plugins of course!

Not enough? Roll your own!
==========================

GoLismero is fully extensible through plugins, and that means you can always roll your own scripts, tailored to your specific needs, or using your favorite tools.

You can start from the [plugin API documentation](http://golismero-project.com/doc/plugin_developers/index.html), and move on to the [full specifications](http://golismero-project.com/doc/fulldoc/index.html) if you want to tinker with GoLismero's internals.

More step-by-step tutorials and howtos are coming soon!

Need help? Found a bug?
=======================

If you have found a bug, you can report it using the Github issues system. You can also drop us an email (golismero.project@gmail.com) or find us on Twitter ([@golismero_pro](https://twitter.com/golismero_pro)).

Known bugs
----------

Some gotchas we already know about:
* Control-C on Python generally doesn't work very well - it may show bogus errors on screen, but you can ignore them. If stopping GoLismero takes too long, try hitting Control-C twice for force shutdown. Even then, sometimes you just have to be a patient!
* GoLismero seems to run slower on Windows than on Linux or Mac. It appears to be related to the Python standard multiprocessing module and the lack of fork() support on Windows.
* This is not a bug, just a reminder: GoLismero by default creates a new database file on each run! You can disable the database creation with the -nd switch.

# Python Module

`tldextract` accurately separates the gTLD or ccTLD (generic or country code
top-level domain) from the registered domain and subdomains of a URL. For
example, say you want just the 'google' part of 'http://www.google.com'.

*Everybody gets this wrong.* Splitting on the '.' and taking the last 2
elements goes a long way only if you're thinking of simple e.g. .com
domains. Think parsing
[http://forums.bbc.co.uk](http://forums.bbc.co.uk) for example: the naive
splitting method above will give you 'co' as the domain and 'uk' as the TLD,
instead of 'bbc' and 'co.uk' respectively.

`tldextract` on the other hand knows what all gTLDs and ccTLDs look like by
looking up the currently living ones according to
[the Public Suffix List](http://www.publicsuffix.org). So,
given a URL, it knows its subdomain from its domain, and its domain from its
country code.

    >>> import tldextract
    >>> tldextract.extract('http://forums.news.cnn.com/')
    ExtractResult(subdomain='forums.news', domain='cnn', suffix='com')
    >>> tldextract.extract('http://forums.bbc.co.uk/') # United Kingdom
    ExtractResult(subdomain='forums', domain='bbc', suffix='co.uk')
    >>> tldextract.extract('http://www.worldbank.org.kg/') # Kyrgyzstan
    ExtractResult(subdomain='www', domain='worldbank', suffix='org.kg')

`ExtractResult` is a namedtuple, so it's simple to access the parts you want.

    >>> ext = tldextract.extract('http://forums.bbc.co.uk')
    >>> ext.domain
    'bbc'
    >>> '.'.join(ext[:2]) # rejoin subdomain and domain
    'forums.bbc'

This module started by implementing the chosen answer from [this StackOverflow question on
getting the "domain name" from a URL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/569137/how-to-get-domain-name-from-url/569219#569219).
However, the proposed regex solution doesn't address many country codes like
com.au, or the exceptions to country codes like the registered domain
parliament.uk. The Public Suffix List does, and so does this module.

## Installation

Latest release on PyPI:

    $ pip install tldextract

Or the latest dev version:

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract.git#egg=tldextract

Command-line usage, splits the url components by space:

    $ tldextract http://forums.bbc.co.uk
    forums bbc co.uk

Run tests:

    $ python -m tldextract.tests.all

## Note About Caching & Advanced Usage

Beware when first running the module, it updates its TLD list with a live HTTP
request. This updated TLD set is cached indefinitely in
`/path/to/tldextract/.tld_set`.

(Arguably runtime bootstrapping like that shouldn't be the default behavior,
like for production systems. But I want you to have the latest TLDs, especially
when I haven't kept this code up to date.)

To avoid this fetch or control the cache's location, use your own extract
callable by setting TLDEXTRACT_CACHE environment variable or by setting the
cache_file path in TLDExtract initialization.

    # extract callable that falls back to the included TLD snapshot, no live HTTP fetching
    no_fetch_extract = tldextract.TLDExtract(fetch=False)
    no_fetch_extract('http://www.google.com')

    # extract callable that reads/writes the updated TLD set to a different path
    custom_cache_extract = tldextract.TLDExtract(cache_file='/path/to/your/cache/file')
    custom_cache_extract('http://www.google.com')

If you want to stay fresh with the TLD definitions--though they don't change
often--delete the cache file occasionally, or run

    tldextract --update

or:

    env TLDEXTRACT_CACHE="~/tldextract.cache" tldextract --update

It is also recommended to delete the file after upgrading this lib.

# Public API

I know it's just one method, but I've needed this functionality in a few
projects and programming languages, so I've uploaded
[`tldextract` to App Engine](http://tldextract.appspot.com/). It's there on
GAE's free pricing plan until Google cuts it off. Just hit it with
your favorite HTTP client with the URL you want parsed like so:

    $ curl "http://tldextract.appspot.com/api/extract?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/foo/bar/baz.html"
    {"domain": "bbc", "subdomain": "www", "suffix": "co.uk"}


This folder contains the external tools bundled with GoLismero.

Whenever a plugin wants to invoke an external tool, this is the first location to be checked. If not found here, the PATH environment variable is used.

# Contributing to sqlmap

## Reporting bugs

**Bug reports are welcome**!
Please report all bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/issues) or, alternatively, to the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sqlmap-users).

### Guidelines

* Before you submit a bug report, search both open and closed issues to make sure the issue has not come up before. Also, check the [user's manual](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki) for anything relevant.
* Make sure you can reproduce the bug with the latest development version of sqlmap.
* Your report should give detailed instructions for how to reproduce the problem. If sqlmap raises an unhandled exception, the traceback is needed. Details of the unexpected behaviour are welcome too. A small test case (just a few lines) is ideal.
* If you are making an enhancement request, lay out the rationale for the feature you are requesting. *Why would this feature be useful?*
* If you are not sure whether something is a bug, or want to discuss a potential new feature before putting in an enhancement request, the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sqlmap-users) is a good place to bring it up.

## Submitting code changes

All code contributions are greatly appreciated. First off, clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap), read the [user's manual](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki) carefully, go through the code yourself and [drop us an email](mailto:dev@sqlmap.org) if you are having a hard time grasping its structure and meaning. We apologize for not commenting the code enough - you could take a chance to read it through and [improve it](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/issues/37).

Our preferred method of patch submission is via a Git [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
Many [people](https://raw.github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/master/doc/THANKS.md) have contributed in different ways to the sqlmap development. **You** can be the next!

### Guidelines

In order to maintain consistency and readability throughout the code, we ask that you adhere to the following instructions:

* Each patch should make one logical change.
* Wrap code to 76 columns when possible.
* Avoid tabbing, use four blank spaces instead.
* Before you put time into a non-trivial patch, it is worth discussing it on the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sqlmap-users) or privately by [email](mailto:dev@sqlmap.org).
* Do not change style on numerous files in one single pull request, we can [discuss](mailto:dev@sqlmap.org) about those before doing any major restyling, but be sure that personal preferences not having a strong support in [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) will likely to be rejected.
* Make changes on less than five files per single pull request - there is rarely a good reason to have more than five files changed on one pull request, as this dramatically increases the review time required to land (commit) any of those pull requests.
* Style that is too different from main branch will be ''adapted'' by the developers side.
* Do not touch anything inside `thirdparty/` and `extra/` folders.

### Licensing

By submitting code contributions to the sqlmap developers, to the mailing list, or via Git pull request, checking them into the sqlmap source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) that you are offering the sqlmap copyright holders the unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code. This is important because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other software projects (such as KDE and NASM). If you wish to specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you send them.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

* The PyDes library located under thirdparty/pydes/.
   Copyleft 2009, Todd Whiteman.

To use cloak.py you need to pass it the original file,
and optionally the output file name.

Example:

$ python ./cloak.py -i backdoor.asp -o backdoor.asp_

This will create an encrypted and compressed binary file backdoor.asp_.

Such file can then be converted to its original form by using the -d
functionality of the cloak.py program:

$ python ./cloak.py -d -i backdoor.asp_ -o backdoor.asp

If you skip the output file name, general rule is that the compressed
file names are suffixed with the character '_', while the original is
get by skipping the last character. So, that means that the upper
examples can also be written in the following form:

$ python ./cloak.py -i backdoor.asp

$ python ./cloak.py -d -i backdoor.asp_

To use dbgtool.py you need to pass it the MS-DOS executable binary file,
and optionally the output debug.exe script file name.

Example:

$ python ./dbgtool.py -i ./nc.exe -o nc.scr

This will create a ASCII text file with CRLF line terminators called
nc.scr.

Such file can then be converted to its original portable executable with
the Windows native debug.exe, that is installed by default in all Windows
systems:

> debug.exe < nc.scr

To be able to execute it on Windows you have to rename it to end with
'.com' or '.exe':

> ren nc_exe nc.exe

icmpsh - simple reverse ICMP shell

icmpsh is a simple reverse ICMP shell with a win32 slave and a POSIX compatible master in C or Perl.


--- Running the Master ---

The master is straight forward to use. There are no extra libraries required for the C version. 
The Perl master however has the following dependencies:

    * IO::Socket
    * NetPacket::IP
    * NetPacket::ICMP


When running the master, don't forget to disable ICMP replies by the OS. For example:

    sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1

If you miss doing that, you will receive information from the slave, but the slave is unlikely to receive
commands send from the master.


--- Running the Slave ---

The slave comes with a few command line options as outlined below:


-t host            host ip address to send ping requests to. This option is mandatory!

-r                 send a single test icmp request containing the string "Test1234" and then quit. 
                   This is for testing the connection.

-d milliseconds    delay between requests in milliseconds 

-o milliseconds    timeout of responses in milliseconds. If a response has not received in time, 
                   the slave will increase a counter of blanks. If that counter reaches a limit, the slave will quit.
                   The counter is set back to 0 if a response was received.

-b num             limit of blanks (unanswered icmp requests before quitting

-s bytes           maximal data buffer size in bytes


In order to improve the speed, lower the delay (-d) between requests or increase the size (-s) of the data buffer.

Files in this folder can be used to compile auxiliary program that can
be used for running command prompt commands skipping standard "cmd /c" way. 
They are licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Compile only the Release version because the Runtime library option
(Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code
Generation) is set to "Multi-threaded (/MT)", which statically links
everything into executable and doesn't compile Debug version at all.

To use safe2bin.py you need to pass it the original file,
and optionally the output file name.

Example:

$ python ./safe2bin.py -i output.txt -o output.txt.bin

This will create an binary decoded file output.txt.bin. For example, 
if the content of output.txt is: "\ttest\t\x32\x33\x34\nnewline" it will 
be decoded to: "	test	234
newline"

If you skip the output file name, general rule is that the binary
file names are suffixed with the string '.bin'. So, that means that 
the upper example can also be written in the following form:

$ python ./safe2bin.py -i output.txt

sqlmap
==

sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

Screenshots
----

![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/wiki/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/images/sqlmap_screenshot.png)

You can visit the [collection of screenshots](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Screenshots) demonstrating some of features on the wiki.

Installation
----

You can download the latest tarball by clicking [here](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/tarball/master) or latest zipball by clicking  [here](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/zipball/master).

Preferably, you can download sqlmap by cloning the [Git](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev

sqlmap works out of the box with [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) version '''2.6.x''' and '''2.7.x''' on any platform.

Usage
----

To get a list of basic options and switches use:

    python sqlmap.py -h

To get a list of all options and switches use:

    python sqlmap.py -hh

You can find sample runs [here](https://gist.github.com/stamparm/5335217).
To get an overview of sqlmap capabilities, list of supported features and description of all options and switches, along with examples, you are advised to consult the [user's manual](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki).

Due to the anti-virus positive detection of shell scripts stored inside
this folder, we needed to somehow circumvent this. As from the plain
sqlmap users perspective nothing has to be done prior to their usage by
sqlmap, but if you want to have access to their original source code use
the decrypt functionality of the ../extra/cloak/cloak.py utility.

To prepare the original scripts to the cloaked form use this command:
find backdoor.* stager.* -type f -exec python ../extra/cloak/cloak.py -i '{}' \;

To get back them into the original form use this:
find backdoor.*_ stager.*_ -type f -exec python ../extra/cloak/cloak.py -d -i '{}' \;

What is this?
-------------

theHarvester is a tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers). 

Is a really simple tool, but very effective for the early stages of a penetration test or just to know the visibility of your company in the Internet.

The actual sources are:

Passive:
--------
-google: google search engine  - www.google.com

-google-profiles: google search engine, specific search for Google profiles

-bing: microsoft search engine  - www.bing.com

-bingapi: microsoft search engine, through the API (you need to add your Key in the discovery/bingsearch.py file)

-pgp: pgp key server - pgp.rediris.es 

-linkedin: google search engine, specific search for Linkedin users

-dogpile: Dogpile search engine

-shodan: Shodan Computer search engine, will search for ports and banner of the discovered hosts  (http://www.shodanhq.com/)

-vhost: Bing virtual hosts search

Active:
-------
-DNS brute force: this plugin will run a dictionary brute force enumeration
-DNS reverse lookup: reverse lookup of ips discovered in order to find hostnames
-DNS TLD expansion: TLD dictionary brute force enumeration using the public suffix list

Dependencies:
------------:
none

Changelog 2.3:
-Added DogPile
-Refactored throughout so that new search engines can be added with minimal change of the core code.
-Refactoring allows us to perform further searches on output (email search on domains found through TLD enumeration?)
-Explicit XML output with filename (-X or output-xml parameters)
-Explicit HTML output with filename (-H or outout-html parameters)
-HTML/XML now include more data
-Shodan search returns the time the data was updated. This is especially useful when it returns multiple results
   for the same host/port that were scanned several time.
-Fixed some bugs/irregularities in the DNS Lookup
-Exalead and Yandex are faulty and have been commented out (see engine_list in theharvester.py)

Changelog 2.2a:
---------------
-Fixed Linkedin parser (thanks Alton Johnson and Francesco Stillavato)
-New banner with superpowers

Changelogin 2.2:
----------------
-Added Jigsaw (www.jigsaw.com)
-Added 123People (www.123people.com)
-Added limit to google searches as the maximum results we can obtain is 1000
-Removed SET, as service was discontinued by Google
-Fixed parser to remove wrong results like emails starting with @


Changelog in 2.1:
----------------
-DNS Bruteforcer
-DNS Reverse lookups
-DNS TDL Expansion
-SHODAN DB integration
-HTML report
-DNS server selection 


Changelog in 2.0:
----------------
-Complete rewrite, more modular and easy to maintain
-New sources (Exalead, Google-Profiles, Bing-Api)
-Time delay between request, to prevent search engines from blocking our IPs
-You can start the search from the results page that you want, hence you can *resume* a search 
-Export to xml
-All search engines harvesting

================================================================
Introduction:
==============================

Cross Site "Scripter" is an automatic -framework- to detect, exploit and report XSS vulnerabilities in web-based applications.

It contains several options to try to bypass certain filters, and various special techniques of code injection.

XSSer is released under the terms of the General Public License v3 and 
is copyrighted by psy (root@lordepsylon.net - epsylon@riseup.net).

================================================================
Options and features:
==============================
 
xsser [OPTIONS] [-u <url> |-i <file> |-d <dork>] [-g <get> |-p <post> |-c <crawl>] [Request(s)] [Vector(s)] [Bypasser(s)] [Technique(s)] [Final Injection(s)]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --statistics      show advanced statistics output results
  -v, --verbose         active verbose mode output results
  --gtk                 launch XSSer GTK Interface (Wizard included!)

  *Special Features*:
    You can choose Vector(s) and Bypasser(s) to inject code with this
    extra special features:

    --imx=IMX           create a false image with XSS code embedded
    --fla=FLASH         create a false .swf file with XSS code embedded

  *Select Target(s)*:
    At least one of these options has to be specified to set the source to
    get target(s) urls from. You need to choose to run XSSer:

    -u URL, --url=URL   Enter target(s) to audit
    -i READFILE         Read target urls from a file
    -d DORK             Process search engine dork results as target urls
    --De=DORK_ENGINE    Search engine to use for dorking (bing, altavista,
                        yahoo, baidu, yandex, youdao, webcrawler, google, etc.
                        See dork.py file to check for available engines)

  *Select type of HTTP/HTTPS Connection(s)*:
    These options can be used to specify which parameter(s) we want to use
    like payload to inject code.

    -g GETDATA          Enter payload to audit using GET (ex: '/menu.php?q=')
    -p POSTDATA         Enter payload to audit using POST (ex: 'foo=1&bar=')
    -c CRAWLING         Number of urls to crawl on target(s): 1-99999
    --Cw=CRAWLER_WIDTH  Deeping level of crawler: 1-5
    --Cl                Crawl only local target(s) urls (default TRUE)

  *Configure Request(s)*:
    These options can be used to specify how to connect to target(s)
    payload(s). You can choose multiple:

    --cookie=COOKIE     Change your HTTP Cookie header
    --drop-cookie       Ignore Set-Cookie header from response
    --user-agent=AGENT  Change your HTTP User-Agent header (default SPOOFED)
    --referer=REFERER   Use another HTTP Referer header (default NONE)
    --xforw             Set your HTTP X-Forwarded-For with random IP values
    --xclient           Set your HTTP X-Client-IP with random IP values
    --headers=HEADERS   Extra HTTP headers newline separated
    --auth-type=ATYPE   HTTP Authentication type (Basic, Digest, GSS or NTLM)
    --auth-cred=ACRED   HTTP Authentication credentials (name:password)
    --proxy=PROXY       Use proxy server (tor: http://localhost:8118)
    --ignore-proxy      Ignore system default HTTP proxy
    --timeout=TIMEOUT   Select your timeout (default 30)
    --retries=RETRIES   Retries when the connection timeouts (default 1)
    --threads=THREADS   Maximum number of concurrent HTTP requests (default 5)
    --delay=DELAY       Delay in seconds between each HTTP request (default 0)
    --tcp-nodelay       Use the TCP_NODELAY option
    --follow-redirects  XSSer will follow server redirection responses (302)
    --follow-limit=FLI  Set how many times XSSer will follow redirections
                        (default 50)

  *Checker Systems*:
    This options are usefull to know if your target(s) have some filters
    against XSS attacks, to reduce 'false positive' results and to perform
    more advanced tests:

    --no-head           NOT verify the stability of the url (codes: 200|302)
                        with a HEAD pre-check request
    --alive=ISALIVE     set limit of every how much errors XSSer must to
                        verify that target is alive
    --hash              send an unique hash, without vectors, to pre-check if
                        target(s) repeats all content recieved
    --heuristic         launch a heuristic testing to discover which
                        parameters are filtered on target(s) code: ;\/<>"'=
    --checkaturl=ALT    check for a valid XSS response from target(s) at an
                        alternative url. 'blind XSS'
    --checkmethod=ALTM  check responses from target(s) using a different
                        connection type: GET or POST (default: GET)
    --checkatdata=ALD   check responses from target(s) using an alternative
                        payload (default: same than first injection)
    --reverse-check     establish a reverse connection from target(s) to XSSer
                        to certificate that is 100% vulnerable

  *Select Vector(s)*:
    These options can be used to specify a XSS vector source code to
    inject in each payload. Important, if you don't want to try to inject
    a common XSS vector, used by default. Choose only one option:

    --payload=SCRIPT    OWN  - Insert your XSS construction -manually-
    --auto              AUTO - Insert XSSer 'reported' vectors from file
                        (HTML5 vectors included!)

  *Select Bypasser(s)*:
    These options can be used to encode selected vector(s) to try to
    bypass possible anti-XSS filters on target(s) code and possible IPS
    rules, if the target use it. Also, can be combined with other
    techniques to provide encoding:

    --Str               Use method String.FromCharCode()
    --Une               Use Unescape() function
    --Mix               Mix String.FromCharCode() and Unescape()
    --Dec               Use Decimal encoding
    --Hex               Use Hexadecimal encoding
    --Hes               Use Hexadecimal encoding, with semicolons
    --Dwo               Encode vectors IP addresses in DWORD
    --Doo               Encode vectors IP addresses in Octal
    --Cem=CEM           Try -manually- different Character Encoding Mutations
                        (reverse obfuscation: good) -> (ex: 'Mix,Une,Str,Hex')

  *Special Technique(s)*:
    These options can be used to try to inject code using different type
    of XSS techniques. You can choose multiple:

    --Coo               COO - Cross Site Scripting Cookie injection
    --Xsa               XSA - Cross Site Agent Scripting
    --Xsr               XSR - Cross Site Referer Scripting
    --Dcp               DCP - Data Control Protocol injections
    --Dom               DOM - Document Object Model injections
    --Ind               IND - HTTP Response Splitting Induced code
    --Anchor            ANC - Use Anchor Stealth payloader (DOM shadows!)
    --Phpids            PHP - Exploit PHPIDS bug (0.6.5) to bypass filters

  *Select Final injection(s)*:
    These options can be used to specify the final code to inject in
    vulnerable target(s). Important, if you want to exploit on-the-wild
    your discovered vulnerabilities. Choose only one option:

    --Fp=FINALPAYLOAD   OWN    - Insert your final code to inject -manually-
    --Fr=FINALREMOTE    REMOTE - Insert your final code to inject -remotelly-
    --Doss              DOSs   - XSS Denial of service (server) injection
    --Dos               DOS    - XSS Denial of service (client) injection
    --B64               B64    - Base64 code encoding in META tag (rfc2397)

  *Special Final injection(s)*:
    These options can be used to execute some 'special' injection(s) in
    vulnerable target(s). You can select multiple and combine with your
    final code (except with DCP code):

    --Onm               ONM - Use onMouseMove() event to inject code
    --Ifr               IFR - Use <iframe> source tag to inject code

  *Miscellaneous*:
    --silent            inhibit console output results
    --update            check for XSSer latest stable version
    --save              output all results directly to template (XSSlist.dat)
    --xml=FILEXML       output 'positives' to aXML file (--xml filename.xml)
    --short=SHORTURLS   display -final code- shortered (tinyurl, is.gd)
    --launch            launch a browser at the end with each XSS discovered
    --tweet             publish each XSS discovered into the 'Grey Swarm!'
    --tweet-tags=TT     add more tags to your XSS discovered publications
                        (default: #xss) - (ex: #xsser #vulnerability)

================================================================
Examples of usage:
==============================

* Simple injection from URL:

$ python XSSer.py -u "http://host.com" -g "bs/?q=" --auto --Doo --short tinyurl

-------------------
* Simple injection from URL, using GET, injecting a vector in Cookie parameter, trying to use a DOM shadow space (no server logging!) and if exists any "hole", applying your manual final payload "malicious" code (ready for real attacks!):

$ python XSSer.py -u "http://host.com" -g "bs/?q=" --Coo --Anchor --Fr="!enter your final injection code here!"

-------------------
* Simple injection from URL, using GET and trying to generate with results a "malicious" shortered link (is.gd) with a valid DoS (Denegation Of Service) browser client payload:

$ python XSSer.py -u "http://host.com" -g "bs/?q=" --Dos --short "is.gd"

-------------------
* Multiple injections to multiple places, extracting targets from a list in a FILE, applying automatic payloading, changing timeout to "20" and using multithreads (5 threads), increasing delay between petitions to 10 seconds, injecting parameters in HTTP USer-Agent, HTTP Referer and in Cookie parameters, using proxy Tor, with IP Octal ofuscation, with statistics results, in verbose mode and creating shortered links (tinyurl) of any valid injecting payloads found. (real playing mode!):
