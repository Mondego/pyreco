Legacy Metadata
===============

## What's this about?

In iOS6, Apple introduced a new, completely self-contained format for its `*.artwork` files.

_Prior_ to iOS6, the information necessary to determine what images were in the `*.artwork` files wasn't found in the artwork files themselves: it was found in a motley assortment of framework binaries. For example, the `UIKit` binary contained an (unexported) symbol that, if you figured out its structure, could tell you the offsets, names, sizes, and colorspaces of the artwork pixels in several related `*.artwork` files.

So: prior to iOS6, I had a (now retired, but you can find it in the git repo's history) script called `generate-from-macho-binary.py` that could crack a framework binary like `UIKit` to figure out what `*.artwork` files it knew about.

Since it was a pain to use `generate-from-macho-binary.py`, I ended up having it output a `json` file for each known `*.artwork` file with the relevant information: image names, sizes, offsets, etc.

This directory contains metadata all the `*.artwork` files that my tool knows about for iOS3 through iOS5. 

Thankfully, this nonsense is no longer necessary with _almost all_ `.artwork` files in iOS6. There are a few stragglers, like `AssistantMic@2x.artwork`. With any luck, this kind of nonsense won't be necessary _at all_ with iOS7. Fingers crossed.




An Important Note About iOS7
============================

### This tool is no longer supported.

June 18, 2013: This extractor tool is officially dead. It will not support `iOS7` or any future release of `iOS`. It will see no future updates for iOS6, either.

Without violating my NDA, `iOS7` introduces a new notion of "asset catalogs" which are managed by `XCode` and which are ultimately compiled down into `.car` files by the `actool` binary.

Asset catalogs in `iOS7` are radically different than the `.artwork` files found in previous versions of `iOS`. They contain images, yes, but they also contain complex metadata (like 3- and 9-grid slicing information), embedded fonts, paths, glyphs, icons, and a whole bunch of other stuff besides.

The bottom line: reverse-engineering these files is going to be a massive undertaking. More importantly, it may not be necessary anymore. Read on for details.

### What you should use instead of this tool.

If you want to extract the contents of `.car` files, you'll want to build a native iOS app that uses undocumented `UIKit` APIs to iterate through the available images. The best option right now is probably `0xced`'s [`UIKit-Artwork-Extractor`](https://github.com/0xced/UIKit-Artwork-Extractor) &mdash; I suspect we'll see it quickly updated for iOS7.

If you want to create _new_ `.car` files, you're in luck: just create an XCode 5 project, create an image catalog, and add your images to it. When you build your project, XCode5 will build a proper `.car` file for you.

Don't want to use XCode projects? No problem; inside the `XCode 5` app bundle is a binary called `actool` that is used to turn an image catalog into a `.car` file. You can `man actool` for more information; it's not terribly well documented, but I was able to get it to create simple and valid `.car` files.

It's worth pointing out some notable disadvantages to this approach over using my tool in the past:

1. You have to be a registered Apple developer in order to use these tools
2. The overall process of extracting images and then creating new archives _for the purposes of modding the iOS UI_ has gotten a lot more cumbersome. (Although a few shell scripts could theoretically help you here.)

### What you should know if you want to try reverse-engineering this stuff.

All this said, it *is* fundamentally possible to update my `iOS-artwork-tool` for `iOS7`. I just don't think it's worth it to do so, especially given that there are other tools that can accomplish similar goals.

If you feel like you're up to the challenge, here's what I know.

Under the hood, the `.car` file format is actually a Mac OS X BOM (Bill Of Materials) file.

Typical BOM files can be manipulated with the `lsbom` and `mkbom` command-line utilities. However, iOS7 `.car` files aren't typical BOM files. Standard BOM files contain a `Paths` variable in the BOM manifest; the `Paths` section is basically a directory tree.

While the new `.car` files are BOM files, they don't contain a `Paths` variable. Instead, they have ten unique variables, including `CARHEADER`, `RENDITIONS`, `COLORS`, `FONTS`, `FONTSIZES`, `GLYPHS`, `BEZELS`, `FACETKEYS`, `ELEMENT_INFO`, and `PART_INFO`. In order to properly support the new `*.car` files, you'll have to reverse-engineer each of these sections. The good news is that `actool` is quite capable of _creating_ content for each of these sections, so it should be possible to generate a number of handy example files from which you can then reverse-engineer the file layout.

One last "gotcha": the Mac OS X BOM file format is itself undocumented. Luckily, someone has taken a crack at it and has built a good-enough implementation of `lsbom` that you can at least get started on understanding the layout of the files. You can find this re-implementation at [cooljeanius/osxbom](https://github.com/cooljeanius/osxbom)

### Thanks for using the extractor throughout the years.

Lots and lots of people have used my extractor, and I really appreciate it!

But the time has come to move on to better tools and approaches. Godspeed, `iOS-artwork-extractor`... Godspeed.

iOS Artwork Extractor for iOS6 and Earlier
==========================================

You may have noticed that most of Apple's iOS artwork is packaged in files ending with the `.artwork` extension. The iOS Artwork Tool makes it easy to export images from those files. Exporting is useful for certain iOS development tasks. The tool also supports creating *new* `.artwork` files from images that you've tweaked; this is useful if you want to create mods that change the basic appearance of the iPhone or iPad's interface.

With iOS6, this tool supports _all_ the SDK `.artwork` files! For SDKs prior to iOS6, only specific `.artwork` files are supported -- namely, all artwork referenced by `UIKit`, including shared artwork, Emoji artwork, and keyboard layout artwork.

### GET STARTED

The software is written in python. You must have Python 2.7 and the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) installed in order for it to work. To do this, create a new `virtualenv`, activate it, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Next, find the appropriate artwork files on disk. This tool supports iOS2 through iOS6. It's up to you to locate the `.artwork` files; if you're an Apple developer with the SDK, look in the Xcode app bundle.

### EXPORTING

To get the images out of a `.artwork` file, you *export* them. This fills a directory of your choosing with easily editable PNG files.

To export, run the tool as follows:

    ./iOS-artwork.py export -a /path/to/artwork_file.artwork -d /path/to/export_directory/

That's all there is to it!

### CREATING

It is equally easy to turn a directory full of PNGs into a new `.artwork` file.

To create a new `.artwork` file, run the tool as follows:

    ./iOS-artwork.py create -a /path/to/original_artwork_file.artwork -d /path/to/import_directory/ -c created_artwork_file.artwork

This will read all the PNGs in the `import_directory` directory and place them in the file named `created_artwork_file.artwork`. Again, easy!

You may wonder why you have to supply the *original* `.artwork` file in this example. That's because the images we import to the newly created `.artwork` must have the same dimensions and color space as the original -- otherwise iOS is likely to be unhappy with you.

### Contact Me

Feel free to send comments, suggestions, and improvements my way. See code comments for details on making improvements. You can find my email address in the information area below.

### What's in this directory?

The `iOS-artwork.py` script is the main workhorse here. It's the only thing you'll want to use.

The `generate-legacy-metadata.py` script is a helper that is capable of reading structs from SDK Mach-O binaries, such as `UIKit`, and finding appropriate symbols and offsets for images. You shouldn't use this.

The `legacy_metadata` directory contains a bunch of JSON files that have metadata about supported `.artwork` files and the images they contain. There's a `README` in there that explains more: as the name implies, this directory only contains metadata for "legacy"-style `.artwork` files. Modern `.artwork` files found in iOS6 don't need this metadata because the `.artwork` files themselves contain it.

Finally, the `artwork` directory is a Python package that contains most of the interesting code for making things work.

### What happened to all the old stuff that used to be part of this repo?

I used to have a bunch of other random stuff in this repo, like tools to help with reading/writing streaming binary data in Objective-C. Most of those bits of code were old and crufty, written in the iOS3 era and in definite need of attention. I axed them, although you can find them if you go back through the `git` history.
