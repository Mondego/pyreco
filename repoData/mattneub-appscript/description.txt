ASDictionary

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. Requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

To install ASDictionary, simply open the ASDictionary-0.10.0.dmg and drag the ASDictionary application to your Applications folder.

To install the asdict command line tool (this is optional), cd to the ASDictionary-0.10.0/bin folder in Terminal and run:

	sudo cp asdict /usr/local/bin && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/asdict


----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND LINE TOOLS

The asdict command line tool can be used to:
- export application dictionaries as plain text and HTML files
- view individual suite, class and command definitions
- display inheritance and containment trees.

Like ASDictionary, asdict supports AppleScript- and appscript-style terminology and can operate in both interactive and non-interactive modes. 

To view the full documentation for asdict, run:

	/usr/local/bin/asdict -h


----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting dictionaries.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.

ASDictionary

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. It can also be used to generate application 'glues' for use with objc-appscript. Requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

To install ASDictionary, simply open the ASDictionary-0.10.0.dmg and drag the ASDictionary application to your Applications folder.

To install the asdict command line tool (this is optional), cd to the ASDictionary-0.10.0/bin folder in Terminal and run:

	sudo cp asdict /usr/local/bin && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/asdict


----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

------- To export application dictionaries -------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


------- To generate objc-appscript glues -------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select the objc-appscript glue format.

3. The ObjC class name prefix for each glue is shown in the Prefix column. The default prefix is the application's name converted to a C-style identifier with the first character always uppercase (e.g. Address Book becomes AddressBook, iCal becomes ICal), but this can be changed by clicking on it and typing a prefix of your choice (e.g. ADBK instead of AddressBook, IC instead of ICal). Take care not to use a prefix that may cause the glue's class names to collide with existing Cocoa classes (e.g. 'NS' is a particularly common prefix and best avoided) otherwise the glue may not compile.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated glue. Each glue folder's name will consist of its class name prefix followed by 'Glue' (e.g. AddressBookGlue, ICGlue).

About ASDictionary
==================

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text 
or HTML format. It can also be used to generate application 'glues' for use 
with objc-appscript. Requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later. 


Exporting application dictionaries
----------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications 
   or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or 
   scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export 
   window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-
   based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option 
   to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 
   'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) 
   Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands 
   in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


Generating objc-appscript glues
-------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications, or
   drag-and-drop one or more application files onto ASDictionary's application 
   icon or Export window.

2. Select the objc-appscript glue format.

3. The ObjC class name prefix for each glue is shown in the Prefix column. 
   The default prefix is an abbreviation of the application's name (e.g. 
   Address Book becomes AB, iCal becomes IC), but this can be changed by 
   clicking on it and typing a prefix of your choice. Take care not to use 
   a prefix that may cause the glue's class names to collide with existing 
   Cocoa classes (e.g. 'NS' is a particularly common prefix and best avoided) 
   otherwise the glue may not compile.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated glue. 
   Each glue folder's name will consist of its class name prefix followed 
   by 'Glue' (e.g. AddressBookGlue, ICGlue).


Scripting ASDictionary
----------------------

ASDictionary provides a single AppleScript command, 'export', for exporting 
application and scripting addition dictionaries. For example:

tell application "ASDictionary"
  export {POSIX file "/Applications/iCal.app", 
           POSIX file"/Applications/iTunes.app"}
         to POSIX file "/Users/jsmith/Documents"
         using file formats {single file HTML, frame based HTML}
         with exporting to subfolders
end tell

See ASDictionary's built-in dictionary for more information.


Notes
-----

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting 
  dictionaries.

- The HTML export options support both applications and scripting additions.
  The plain text and objc glue export options support applications only.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness 
  may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the 
  additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application 
  dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. 
  Should this happen, try exporting the dictionary as plain text instead.

About ASDictionary
==================

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text 
or HTML format. It can also be used to generate application 'glues' for use 
with objc-appscript. Requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later. 


Exporting application dictionaries
----------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications 
   or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or 
   scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export 
   window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-
   based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option 
   to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 
   'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) 
   Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands 
   in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


Generating objc-appscript glues
-------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications, or
   drag-and-drop one or more application files onto ASDictionary's application 
   icon or Export window.

2. Select the objc-appscript glue format.

3. The ObjC class name prefix for each glue is shown in the Prefix column. 
   The default prefix is an abbreviation of the application's name (e.g. 
   Address Book becomes AB, iCal becomes IC), but this can be changed by 
   clicking on it and typing a prefix of your choice. Take care not to use 
   a prefix that may cause the glue's class names to collide with existing 
   Cocoa classes (e.g. 'NS' is a particularly common prefix and best avoided) 
   otherwise the glue may not compile.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated glue. 
   Each glue folder's name will consist of its class name prefix followed 
   by 'Glue' (e.g. AddressBookGlue, ICGlue).


Scripting ASDictionary
----------------------

ASDictionary provides a single AppleScript command, 'export', for exporting 
application and scripting addition dictionaries. For example:

tell application "ASDictionary"
  export {POSIX file "/Applications/iCal.app", 
           POSIX file"/Applications/iTunes.app"}
         to POSIX file "/Users/jsmith/Documents"
         using file formats {single file HTML, frame based HTML}
         with exporting to subfolders
end tell

See ASDictionary's built-in dictionary for more information.


Notes
-----

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting 
  dictionaries.

- The HTML export options support both applications and scripting additions.
  The plain text and objc glue export options support applications only.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness 
  may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the 
  additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application 
  dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. 
  Should this happen, try exporting the dictionary as plain text instead.

- The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support 
  their built-in help systems. You can specify text wrapping options for help 
  system output in ASDictionary's Preferences window.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.

- By default, ASDictionary uses its built-in HTML template to render AppleScript dictionaries. To have it use an external HTML template, copy the ASDictionary folder located within the Templates folder to your ~/Library/Application Support folder. You can then edit the ~/Library/Application Support/ASDictionary/Template.html file to use a different CSS stylesheet, or to make minor modifications to the HTML markup. 

Note that HTML elements containing special 'node' attributes are used by ASDictionary to insert content. Deleting or moving these elements may break the template unless you modify ASDictionary as well; see the Source folder.

HISTORY

2006-09-19 -- 0.6.2; renamed to ASDictionary

2006-08-26 -- 0.6.1; now uses appscript 0.16.2 - this fixes some additional HTML rendering problems; combining duplicate class definitions into one is now optional

2006-08-17 -- 0.6.0; now uses appscript 0.16.1 - this fixes rendering problems for applications that have classes in hidden suites, where visible classes by the same name could end up moved to the hidden suite and therefore fail to show up in HTML output (e.g. Mail 2's 'application' class); changed licence from LGPL to MIT; Universal build

2005-11-22 -- 0.5.0; now supports optional external HTML template for AppleScript dictionaries; new icon; no longer renders HTML dictionaries for applications that don't have one

2005-05-27 -- 0.4.1; now ignores invalid reference forms instead of erroring

2005-05-13 -- 0.4.0; now generates appscript-style terminology; allows selection of multiple formats

2005-04-29 -- 0.3.0; more forgiving of weird and broken dictionaries; merges DumpAETE functionality; improves hyperlinking; new cheesy icon

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. Requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND LINE TOOLS

The optional asdict command-line tool can be used to:
- export application dictionaries as plain text and HTML files
- view individual suite, class and command definitions
- display inheritance and containment trees.

Like ASDictionary, asdict supports AppleScript- and appscript-style terminology and can operate in both interactive and non-interactive modes. 

To install asdict, cd to the ASDictionary-0.9.0/bin folder in Terminal.app and run:

	sudo cp asdict /usr/local/bin && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/asdict

To view the full documentation for asdict, run:

	/usr/local/bin/asdict -h


----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting dictionaries.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.

----------------------------
Appscript Support

The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support their built-in help systems. You can set the preferences for ASDictionary's appscript support via its Preferences window. 

In particular, rb-appscript users should check that the 'Ruby interpreter' option provides a valid path to a ruby interpreter (the default is /usr/bin/ruby), and ensure the Ruby installation used by that interpreter has rb-appscript installed. If a valid interpreter path is not given, or the Ruby installation specified does not have rb-appscript installed, rb-appscript's help system will display references and values using Python rather than Ruby syntax.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
DONATIONS

ASDictionary is free to use; however, any donations will be gratefully received and will help to support future development. You can donate to the appscript project (which ASDictionary belongs to) via its project page at sourceforge.net:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/appscript

Many thanks to all those who have already contributed.

About ASDictionary
==================

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text 
or HTML format. It can also be used to generate application 'glues' for use 
with objc-appscript. Requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later. 


Exporting application dictionaries
----------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications 
   or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or 
   scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export 
   window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-
   based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option 
   to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 
   'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) 
   Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands 
   in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


Generating objc-appscript glues
-------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications, or
   drag-and-drop one or more application files onto ASDictionary's application 
   icon or Export window.

2. Select the objc-appscript glue format.

3. The ObjC class name prefix for each glue is shown in the Prefix column. 
   The default prefix is an abbreviation of the application's name (e.g. 
   Address Book becomes AB, iCal becomes IC), but this can be changed by 
   clicking on it and typing a prefix of your choice. Take care not to use 
   a prefix that may cause the glue's class names to collide with existing 
   Cocoa classes (e.g. 'NS' is a particularly common prefix and best avoided) 
   otherwise the glue may not compile.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated glue. 
   Each glue folder's name will consist of its class name prefix followed 
   by 'Glue' (e.g. AddressBookGlue, ICGlue).


Scripting ASDictionary
----------------------

ASDictionary provides a single AppleScript command, 'export', for exporting 
application and scripting addition dictionaries. For example:

tell application "ASDictionary"
  export {POSIX file "/Applications/iCal.app", 
           POSIX file"/Applications/iTunes.app"}
         to POSIX file "/Users/jsmith/Documents"
         using file formats {single file HTML, frame based HTML}
         with exporting to subfolders
end tell

See ASDictionary's built-in dictionary for more information.


Notes
-----

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting 
  dictionaries.

- The HTML export options support both applications and scripting additions.
  The plain text and objc glue export options support applications only.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness 
  may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the 
  additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application 
  dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. 
  Should this happen, try exporting the dictionary as plain text instead.

- The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support 
  their built-in help systems. You can specify text wrapping options for help 
  system output in ASDictionary's Preferences window.

ASTranslate

-----------------------------------
ABOUT

A simple tool for converting application commands written in AppleScript into their appscript equivalent.

Usage:

1. Launch ASTranslate and type or paste one or more AppleScript commands into the top half of the window, e.g.:

	tell application "TextEdit" to get text of every document

	with timeout of 10 seconds		tell application "Finder" to folder 1 of home as alias	end timeout

2. Select Document > Translate. The AppleScript code is compiled and executed, and the bottom pane displays each Apple event sent by AppleScript as Python appscript code, e.g.:

	app(u'/Applications/TextEdit.app').documents.text.get()

	app(u'/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app').home.folders[1].get(resulttype=k.Alias, timeout=10)

-----------------------------------
NOTES

- ASTranslate only sniffs outgoing Apple events sent by AppleScript; it's not a full-blown AppleScript->Python code converter or anything like that.

- The output is fairly dumb, but is handy when figuring out how to translate a particular reference or command from AppleScript to Python.

- Don't forget that all Apple events sent by AppleScript will be passed to applications to be handled as normal. i.e. Destructive commands (e.g. 'tell "Finder" to delete some file') will still do their destructive thing; invalid or unsuccessful commands will cause AppleScript to raise an error, etc.

-----------------------------------
HISTORY

2006-08-17 -- 0.2.0; updated for appscript 0.16.1; fixed 'make' command rendering bug

2006-01-05 -- 0.1.1; now renders complex filter references correctly

2005-12-07 -- 0.1.0; first release

Notes
-----

- ASTranslate only sniffs outgoing Apple events sent by AppleScript; it's

  is not intended to be production-ready code, but should be helpful when 
  figuring out how to translate a particular reference or command from 
  AppleScript to Python/Ruby/ObjC.

- ASTranslate translates application commands only. Scripting addition 
  commands are not translated automatically, but should be straightforward
  to translate manually using dictionaries exported from ASDictionary. 

- Use ASDictionary 0.13.0 or later to generate objc-appscript glues.

- The objc-appscript renderer creates two-letter class name prefixes based

     app(u'Finder').home.folders[1].get(resulttype=k.alias, timeout=10)

Click on the tabs below the bottom pane to switch between Python, Ruby and 
ObjC translations. 

The 'Send events to app' checkbox can be unchecked to prevent Apple events 
being sent to the target application. This is particularly useful when 
obtaining translations of potentially destructive commands such as 'delete'.


Notes
-----

- ASTranslate only sniffs outgoing Apple events sent by AppleScript; it's 
  not a full-blown AppleScript->Python/Ruby/ObjC code converter. The output 
  is not intended to be production-ready code, but should be helpful when 
  figuring out how to translate a particular reference or command from 
  AppleScript to Python/Ruby/ObjC.

- ASTranslate translates application commands only. Scripting addition 
  commands are not translated automatically, but should be straightforward
  to translate manually using dictionaries exported from ASDictionary. 

- Use ASDictionary 0.13.1 or later to generate objc-appscript glues.

- The objc-appscript renderer creates two-letter class name prefixes based 
  on the application name for demonstration purposes. If using ASTranslate-
  generated code in your own projects, remember to modify these prefixes to 
  match the names generated by osaglue, or vice-versa.

- If the 'Send events to app' option is checked, remember that all Apple 
  events sent by AppleScript will be passed to applications to be handled as 
  normal. i.e. Destructive commands (e.g. 'tell "Finder" to delete some file')
  will still do their destructive thing; invalid or unsuccessful commands will
  cause AppleScript to raise an error, etc.

- Unchecking the 'Send events to app' option also prevents an application 
  command from returning a result; if the following AppleScript code expects 
  a return value, this will likely result in a script error.

About ASTranslate
=================

A simple tool for converting application commands written in AppleScript into 
their appscript equivalent.


Usage
-----

1. Launch ASTranslate and type or paste one or more AppleScript commands into 
   the top half of the window, e.g.:

     tell application "TextEdit" to get text of every document

     with timeout of 10 seconds
       tell application "Finder" to folder 1 of home as alias
     end timeout

2. Select Document > Translate. The AppleScript code is compiled and executed, 
   and the bottom pane displays each Apple event sent by AppleScript as 
   appscript code, e.g.:

     app(u'TextEdit').documents.text.get()

     app(u'Finder').home.folders[1].get(resulttype=k.alias, timeout=10)

About macruby-appscript
=======================

MacRuby appscript (macruby-appscript) is a high-level, user-friendly 
Apple event bridge that allows you to control AppleScriptable Mac OS X
applications from Ruby.


Requirements
------------

- MacRuby appscript supports MacRuby 0.8 and later.

- MacRuby appscript requires objc-appscript 0.5.0 or later.


Installation
------------

To install macruby-appscript, cd to the macruby-appscript-0.1.0 directory 
and run:

  macruby setup.rb

To install objc-appscript:

  http://appscript.sourceforge.net/objc-appscript/install.html

When building the Appscript.framework from source, use one of the following
build settings:

  Release_10.5_32_64_GC -- for installing in /Library/Frameworks
  
  Release_10.5_32_64_GC_embed -- for embedding in .app bundles

Both configurations are suitable for use with MacRuby. The only difference 
is that the embedded configuration sets the Installation Directory to
@executable_path/../Frameworks, so should be used when bundling the
Appscript.framework in a MacRuby-based application for distribution.


Notes
-----

- While macruby-appscript's design is derived from rb-appscript, there are 
  some significant differences:
  
  - Rb-appscript uses a three-layer architecture, consisting of native Ruby 
    Appscript and AEM modules and a C-based AE extension. In macruby-
    appscript, only the top-level Appscript module is implemented natively; 
    the AEM and AE layers are replaced by objc-appscript's AEM API and 
    Cocoa's NSAppleEventDescriptor class. In practice, this should only 
    affect users when dealing with applications that have faulty or missing 
    terminology, or when packaging MacRuby-based applications for release.
    
  - Rb-appscript maps common Apple event types to standard Ruby classes where
    practical and maps other types to custom classes provided by the MacTypes
    module where no native equivalents exist. MacRuby appscript relies on  
    the objc-appscript framework to map Apple event types to standard Cocoa 
    classes or to custom objc-appscript classes where no Cocoa equivalents
    exist. For example, a descriptor of typeUnicodeText is mapped to NSString
    while a descriptor of typeAlias is mapped to ASAlias. The only exceptions 
    are typeTrue and typeFalse descriptors, which macruby-appscript maps to 
    'true' and 'false' rather than objc-appscript's ASBoolean class.
    
  - Rb-appscript represents the keyword parameters in an application command
    as an inline hash, e.g. make(:new => :document), whereas macruby-appscript 
    uses MacRuby's simpler selector syntax, e.g. make(new: :document).

======================================================================
NOTES

- This Distutils package will install aem, aemreceive, appscript, CarbonX, macfile, osaterminology and osax; these will all be installed in site-packages/aeosa. Previous versions of these packages will need to be removed manually before use.

- Documentation and examples should now be installed at /Developer/Python. (Previous versions were installed in /Applications/Utilities/appscript; these should be removed manually.)

- ASTS has been dropped. Existing installations should be removed manually.

- The appscript API has undergone several changes, including the following:

	- the filter reference form syntax has changed (you will need to update your scripts accordingly)

	- 'app' is no longer a class (only an issue if subclassing it/using it for typechecking purposes)

- The aem and osaterminology packages have also undergone significant changes. See the documentation for details.

- appscript 0.16.1+ uses 'ascrgdte' events to retrieve terminology for both local and remote applications (previous versions used OSAGetAppTerminology). Due to a bug in Cocoa Scripting (bug id #4677156), classes and commands defined in hidden 'tpnm' suites are lost, so class, property and command names that are only defined there won't be available to appscript (e.g. the obsoleted 'title' property in iCal 2's dictionary is missing, so scripts written to work on OS 10.3 will need to be modified to work on OS 10.4 and vice-versa).

- Appscript and aem are now moving towards beta 1 status, so please report any problems you have either with the appscript bridge itself or with scripting individual applications. In particular, appscript is a bit more sensitive to application bugs and terminology flaws than AppleScript is, so will sometimes fail on tasks where AppleScript works; identifying these problem apps so that internal/external workarounds can be developed will be useful.

Appscript is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities (a.k.a. Distutils). To install appscript, cd to the appscript-0.16.3 directory and run:

	python setup.py bdist_mpkg --open

Building appscript from source requires bdist_mpkg (http://undefined.org/python/) and the gcc compiler (supplied with Apple's Developer Tools).

Appscript requires MacPython 2.3 or later and Mac OS X 10.3 or later.


======================================================================
NOTES

- This Distutils package will install aem, aemreceive, appscript, CarbonX, macfile, osaterminology and osax; these will all be installed in site-packages/aeosa. Previous versions of these packages will need to be removed manually before use.

- Documentation and examples should now be installed at /Developer/Python. (Previous versions were installed in /Applications/Utilities/appscript; these should be removed manually.)

- ASTS has been dropped. Existing installations should be removed manually.

- The appscript API has undergone several changes, including the following:

	- the filter reference form syntax has changed (you will need to update your scripts accordingly)

	- 'app' is no longer a class (only an issue if subclassing it/using it for typechecking purposes)

- The aem and osaterminology packages have also undergone significant changes. See the documentation for details.

- appscript 0.16.1+ uses 'ascrgdte' events to retrieve terminology for both local and remote applications (previous versions used OSAGetAppTerminology). Due to a bug in Cocoa Scripting (bug id #4677156), classes and commands defined in hidden 'tpnm' suites are lost, so class, property and command names that are only defined there won't be available to appscript (e.g. the obsoleted 'title' property in iCal 2's dictionary is missing, so scripts written to work on OS 10.3 will need to be modified to work on OS 10.4 and vice-versa).

- Appscript and aem are now moving towards beta 1 status, so please report any problems you have either with the appscript bridge itself or with scripting individual applications. In particular, appscript is a bit more sensitive to application bugs and terminology flaws than AppleScript is, so will sometimes fail on tasks where AppleScript works; identifying these problem apps so that internal/external workarounds can be developed will be useful.

======================================================================
NOTES

- Appscript 0.19.0 is a significant restructuring of the appscript 0.18.x package. Several non-core modules - aemreceive, osaterminology, CarbonX.OSA/osascript - have been moved to separate projects. The remaining codebase has been cleaned up and reworked to enable 64-bit support.

- The following modules now provide full 64-bit support: aem, appscript, mactypes. The osax module currently provides partial 64-bit support; see doc/osax-manual for details.

-------

- Except for the removed modules, appscript's high-level public APIs remain almost entirely unaffected by these changes, so the vast majority of existing code should require no changes. API changes which may affect some users are:

	- The osax.ScriptingAddition class has been renamed to osax.OSAX. The previous class name is deprecated, though currently remains supported for backwards compatibility.

	- The mactypes module's Alias and File classes no longer provide methods for working with Python's Carbon.Alias and Carbon.File types, so any existing code that uses these methods will need to be updated accordingly. See the CHANGES file for more details.

	- The aem.CommandError class has been renamed to aem.EventError. The previous class name is deprecated and will be removed in the 1.0.0 release.

	- The 'number' and 'message' attributes in aem.EventError are deprecated and will be removed in the 1.0.0 release; clients should use aem.EventError's errornumber and errormessage attributes instead.

	- The CarbonX package is deprecated and will be removed completely in the 1.0.0 release; client code that refers to CarbonX.AE and/or CarbonX.kAE should be updated to use aem.ae and/or aem.kae instead. 

	- The low-level public APIs in the aem.ae extension (which includes the aem.ae.AEDesc type) have been cleaned up and renamed. See aem.ae's docstrings for details.

--------

- Developer tools for exporting application dictionaries (ASDictionary) and converting application commands from AppleScript to appscript syntax (ASTranslate) are available separately:

	http://appscript.sourceforge.net/tools.html

- ASDictionary 0.9.0 or later is now required to use appscript's built-in help() method (ASDictionary 0.11.0 or later is recommended). If ASDictionary isn't installed, interactive help won't be available but appscript will continue to operate as normal.

-------

- Appscript 0.19.0 is beta 1. Please report any problems you encounter either in the appscript bridge or in using it to control particular applications.

	- The osax.scriptingadditions attribute is now a function, so any existing code that uses this attribute will need to be updated accordingly. See the CHANGES file for more details.

	- The mactypes module's Alias and File classes no longer provide methods for working with Python's Carbon.Alias and Carbon.File types, so any existing code that uses these methods will need to be updated accordingly. See the CHANGES file for more details.

	- The aem.CommandError class has been renamed to aem.EventError. The previous class name is deprecated and will be removed in the 1.0.0 release.

	- The 'number' and 'message' attributes in aem.EventError are deprecated and will be removed in the 1.0.0 release; clients should use aem.EventError's errornumber and errormessage attributes instead.

	- The CarbonX package is deprecated and will be removed completely in the 1.0.0 release; client code that refers to CarbonX.AE and/or CarbonX.kAE should be updated to use aem.ae and/or aem.kae instead. 

	- The low-level public APIs in the aem.ae extension (which includes the aem.ae.AEDesc type) have been cleaned up and renamed. See aem.ae's docstrings for details.

Some of the code in these tests may not yet be 100% portable (hardcoded paths, etc) so may currently fail for some users, although they have been passed on G4 and i386 hardware running OS X 10.4.x + Python 2.5.

Note that some mactypes unit tests may fail as Alias and File comparisons are rather dumb and don't normalise path strings before comparing/hashing. Future releases may try to remedy this.
Appscript is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities (a.k.a. Distutils). To install appscript, cd to the appscript-0.20.2 directory and run:

	python setup.py install

Setuptools will be used if available, otherwise the setup.py script will revert to distutils.

Building appscript from source requires the gcc compiler (supplied with Apple's Developer Tools). Setuptools is available from <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi>. (Note: Python 2.6.3 does not work correctly with setuptools; this and other issues are addressed in 2.6.4.)

Mac OS X 10.6 users: You will need to install the Mac OS X 10.4u SDK (included in the Xcode 3.2 installer) before you can build py-appscript for python.org's Python framework distributions, which are built with the 10.4 SDK. In addition, gcc 4.0, not the default 4.2, must be used to build extensions against the 10.4 SDK (Python 2.6.4 will automatically use gcc 4.0).

Appscript requires Python 2.3 or later and Mac OS X 10.3.9 or later. 

This appscript distribution supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Documentation and sample scripts for each can be found under the appscript_2x and appscript_3x directories.


======================================================================
NOTES

- Appscript 0.19.0+ is a significant restructuring of the appscript 0.18.x package. Several non-core modules - aemreceive, osaterminology, CarbonX.OSA/osascript - have been moved to separate projects. The remaining codebase has been cleaned up and reworked to enable 64-bit support.

- The following modules now provide full 64-bit support: aem, appscript, mactypes. The osax module currently provides partial 64-bit support; see doc/osax-manual for details.

- The aem, appscript and mactypes modules provide full 64-bit support. The osax module provides partial 64-bit support; see doc/osax-manual for details.

-------

Appscript 0.21.0 tidies up a number of deprecated APIs in appscript_2x:

	- The aem.CommandError class name has been removed. Clients should use aem.EventError instead.

	- The aem.CantLaunchApplicationError.number attribute has been removed. Clients should use aem.CantLaunchApplicationError.errornumber instead.

	- The aem.EventError.number and aem.EventError.message attributes have been removed. Clients should use aem.EventError.errornumber and aem.EventError.errormessage instead.

	- The CarbonX package has been removed. Client code that refers to CarbonX.AE and/or CarbonX.kAE should be updated to use aem.ae and/or aem.kae instead. 

	- The osax.ScriptingAddition class name is deprecated, though it remains supported on Python 2.x for backwards compatibility. Clients should use osax.OSAX instead.

--------

Prior to 0.21.0, appscript used a number of Process Manager APIs that would automatically promote a GUI-less process to a full GUI process if its executable was located in a .app bundle. Since a standard Python 2.4+ framework build keeps its python interpreter in an embedded Python.app bundle, this would result in increased startup time and the appearance of a bouncing Python.app icon in the Dock. 

This GUI-fication of a python process can be irritating to users; it's also quite unnecessary in this case as appscript does not require a Window Manager connection to operate. Therefore, appscript 0.21.0 avoids using Process Manager functions that are known to trigger GUI promotion in 10.5 and later, so that the Python.app icon no longer appears in the Dock. 

Unfortunately, other system APIs still used by appscript will automatically promote a python interpreter to GUI status when running appscript-based scripts on Mac OS X 10.4 or on a copy of Python that was built against the 10.4 SDK (e.g. the python.org framework distributions). As appscript cannot avoid using some Process Manager APIs, users who don't wish to see a bouncing Python.app icon in the Dock may need to take additional steps to avoid triggering it. 

Some options:

1. On 10.5+, run appscript-based scripts using the Apple-supplied Python, which is built with a newer SDK.

2. On 10.5+, avoid using python.org's prebuilt framework distributions. Instead, build a Python framework from source using the 10.5 SDK or later, and run appscript-based scripts with that.

3. Copy the python executable from the Python framework's Python.app bundle into /usr/local/bin, renaming it as appropriate, and run appscript-based scripts with that.

4. Tolerate the Python.app icon appearing in the Dock; while annoying, it's (mostly) harmless.

-------

- Appscript 0.21.0 is beta 4. The API is frozen and no more features will be added prior to final release; only errors or significant omissions in code or documentation will be addressed. Please report any problems you encounter either in the appscript bridge or in using it to control particular applications ASAP. If no further issues are discovered, a 1.0.0 final release will follow.

Appscript supports Python 2.3 to 2.7, and Python 3.1 and later.

Appscript requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.


Installation
------------

Appscript is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities 
(a.k.a. Distutils). To install appscript, cd to the appscript-1.0.0 
directory and run:

  python setup.py install

or:

  python3 setup.py install


Setuptools/Distribute (available from <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi>) 
will be used if installed, otherwise setup.py will revert to Distutils.

Building appscript from source requires the gcc compiler supplied with 
Apple's Xcode IDE. Xcode can be obtained from Mac OS X installer disks
or <http://developer.apple.com>.


Notes
-----

- Python 2.x documentation and sample scripts can be found in the 
  appscript_2x/doc and appscript_2x/sample directories.

- Python 3.x documentation and sample scripts can be found in the 
  appscript_3x/doc and appscript_3x/sample directories.

- Developer tools for exporting application dictionaries (ASDictionary) 
  and converting application commands from AppleScript to appscript 
  syntax (ASTranslate) are available separately:

    http://appscript.sourceforge.net/tools.html

  ASDictionary 0.13.1 or later is also required to use appscript's built-in 
  help() method. If ASDictionary isn't installed, interactive help won't be 
  available but appscript will continue to operate as normal.

iTunes 10.6.3 broke appscript because Hamish's method of fetching the dictionary, using an ascr/gdte Apple event, no longer works.

*STOP READING!* iTunes 11.0.1 has fixed that bug. rb-appscript now works just fine with iTunes once again. The fix discussed in this note is no longer needed.

*START READING AGAIN!* iTunes may be fixed, but now the Finder is broken (in Mountain Lion). So you do need this note, in order to script the Finder with rb-appscript. And who knows what else Apple may break?

Fortunately there are other ways to get the dictionary that do still work. I have written a script, *sdefToRBAppscriptModule.rb*, that works around the problem by using a different way of fetching the dictionary, namely by calling the `sdef` command-line tool.

Here's how to use it:

    require 'appscript'
    require 'sdefToRBAppscriptModule.rb' # I have it installed my Ruby library
    
    # start with path to scriptable application
    # f = "/Applications/iTunes.app"
    
    # if what you have isn't a path, use the FindApp module to get it
    f = FindApp.by_id('com.apple.finder')
    
    Finder = SDEFParser.makeModule(f)
    finder = Appscript.app("Finder", Finder)
    
    # and we're off to the races
    p finder.windows[1].name.get # or whatever

Share and enjoy. Please fork and pull-request if you improve on this script.

Some of the code in these tests may not yet be 100% portable (hardcoded paths, etc) so may currently fail for some users, although they have passed for Ruby 1.8.x on OS X 10.3.9, OS X 10.4.x (PPC & i386) and OS X 10.5.1 (i386).

Note that some mactypes unit tests may fail as Alias and FileURL comparisons are rather dumb and don't normalise path strings before comparing/hashing. Future releases may try to remedy this.
About rb-appscript
==================

Ruby appscript (rb-appscript) is a high-level, user-friendly Apple event 
bridge that allows you to control AppleScriptable Mac OS X applications 
from Ruby.


Requirements
------------

Appscript supports Ruby 1.8 and later.

Appscript requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.


Installation
------------

To install appscript, cd to the rb-appscript-0.6.0 directory and run:

  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  sudo make install


Building appscript from source requires the gcc compiler supplied with 
Apple's Xcode IDE. Xcode can be obtained from Mac OS X installer disks
or <http://developer.apple.com>.

Please note that the version of Ruby included with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) 
is missing the header files needed to build appscript on PPC-based Macs. 
Tiger users can avoid this issue by installing the latest version of Ruby 
from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/> and updating their shell 
login profiles to suit.


Notes
-----

- rb-appscript 0.6.0 supports string encodings in Ruby 1.9+; see the CHANGES 
  file and documentation for details.

- Developer tools for exporting application dictionaries (ASDictionary) 
  and converting application commands from AppleScript to appscript syntax 
  (ASTranslate) are available separately:

    http://appscript.sourceforge.net/tools.html

  ASDictionary 0.12.0 or later is also required to use rb-appscript's built-
  in #help method. If ASDictionary isn't installed, interactive help won't 
  be available but appscript will continue to operate as normal.

- This is a Beta release. Please report any issues you find, particularly in 
  the new Ruby 1.9 string encoding support which is not yet heavily tested. 
  If no major problems are reported, Release Candidate 1 will follow.

This is Hamish Sanderson's appscript, imported from sourceforge (svn) to github (git).

Original source: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/appscript>

Hamish has made it very clear that he isn't willing to touch this code any further. So it seems obligatory that someone else should put it in a place and form where people can fork it and continue to maintain it. Here it is, then. Please fork and let's carry on. 

### GROUND OF BEING

This is open source. That means if you think there's a problem, and you care about it, you figure out Hamish's code and fix it. Keeping appscript alive is not *my* responsibility, it's *everyone's* responsibility. I didn't write it. I'm not its keeper. All I did was move it over from sourceforge to a good place. Less whining and more coding, please. Thank you.

### NOTE

I am interested personally in rb-appscript. Python users and Objective-C users, you should fork and solve issues as they arise. I have no knowledge of Python and no way to test, so I don't want to take responsibility for changes in the Python code.

### ISSUES

rb-appscript broke against iTunes, and later against the Finder. There's no reason in the world, however, why appscript should stop working just because Hamish insists on using `'ascr/gdte'` as a way of fetching an application's dictionary. There are many other ways to fetch the dictionary that work perfectly well with appscript. Please see the rbappscript folder for my solution (for rb-appscript). It should not be difficult for a Python person to imitate this in Python if desired.

Another problem that has come to my attention is that there may be something wrong with the rb-appscript gemspec, such that it doesn't install properly. I don't know anything about gemspecs, and no one has suggested a fix. However, there's an easy workaround: install manually, like this:

    $ cd /path/to/trunk
    $ ruby extconf.rb
    $ make
    $ make install

That installs into the Ruby library, and I actually like that better than using rb-appscript as a gem anyway.
