Pygcurse v0.1 alpha

http://inventwithpython.com/pygcurse


Pygcurse (pronounced "pig curse") is a curses library emulator that runs on top of the Pygame framework. It provides an easy way to create text adventures, rougelikes, and console-style applications.

Unfortunately, the curses library that comes with the Python standard library does not work on Windows. The excellent Console module from effbot provides curses-like features, but it only runs on Windows and not Mac/Linux. By using Pygame, Pygcurse is able to run on all platforms.

Pygcurse provides several benefits over normal text-based stdio programs:

    1) Color text and background.
    2) The ability to move the cursor and print text anywhere in the console window.
    3) The ability to make console apps that make use of the mouse.
    4) The ability to have programs respond to individual key presses, instead of waiting for the user to type an entire string and press enter (as with input()/raw_input()).
    5) Since the console window that Pygcurse uses is just a Pygame surface object, additional drawing and transformations can be applied to it. Multiple consoles can also be used in the same program.

Pygcurse requires Pygame to be installed. Pygame can be downloaded from http://pygame.org

NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR:
This module is still in alpha and may have bugs. Please submit any bug reports to the github.com page. Also, this module comes with several demo programs:

- demo_hello.py       : A basic Hello World program using Pygcurse.
- demo_dodger.py      : A game where the mouse controls the player, who must dodge the falling green blocks for as long as possible.
- demo_maze.py        : A maze game where the user must use the arrow keys to move the player towards the green exit.
- demo_reversi.py     : An example of converting a previously stdio text-based program into a Pygcurse program with minimal effort.
- demo_tictactoe.py   : Another game that was formerly a text-based program.
- demo_shadowtest.py  : A test program that demonstrates Pygcurse's tinting and shadow features, as well as the line drawing function.
- demo_textboxtest.py : A test program that demonstrates Pygcurse's PygcurseTextbox class, which makes it easy to display text boxes on the screen.

Feel free to play around with them. Email me any questions/comments you have. I'm very much interested in expanding this module with new features (or fixing any bugs).
