h1. The Missing Processing Bundle for TextMate

A TextMate bundle for Processing programmers. Run, present, and export your sketches. Bundle should be considered alpha. I haven't found any critical bugs using my old MacBook Pro, but I also don't have access to any other macs with TextMate, so please contact me if you find any bugs.
