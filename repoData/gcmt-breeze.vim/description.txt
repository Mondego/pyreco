### Houston, we have a problem
For any functionality listed below, if it seems that something is not working
correctly (e.g. unresponsive commands), run the `BreezeWhatsWrong` command and
you will be shown the origin of the problem, usually something related to bad
formatted HTML.


## Tag jumping
![Screenshot](extra/jump.gif "Tag jumping inspired by vim-easymotion")   

As you can see this way of navigating the document is heavily inspired by
vim-easymotion. You can use the command `BreezeJumpF` to jump to following
tags and the `BreezeJumpB` command to jump to preceding tags.

When you run one of the aforementioned commands, Breeze displays
colored marks on the tags you can jump to and wait for your choice.
Once you have moved to a tag you can easily jump back using the `CTRL+O` 
vim mapping (:help CTRL+O). Note that when you are asked to insert the target
key you can exit the whole process pressing either `<ESC>` or `CTRL+C`.


## Tag matching and current element highlighting
![Screenshot](extra/high.gif "Current element highlighting")   

By default Breeze highlights the opening and closing tags of the current
element. To turn off this functionality you can set
`g:breeze_highlight_curr_element` to 0. However, you always have at your
disposal the `BreezeHlElement` command to highlight the current element.

Another useful command is `BreezeMatchTag`. If the cursor is on an opening tag,
this command moves the cursor to the corresponding closing tag, and vice-versa.
If the command is called within an element, this command moves the cursor to
its opening tag. Remember that you can easily jump back to previous positions
with `CTRL+O`.

**Limitations:** At the moment current element highlighting is still
inefficient for large files and your movements may become quite slow when the
file is modified.


## DOM navigation
![Screenshot](extra/dom.gif "DOM navigation")   

Commands for DOM navigation cover only low level movements at the moment but
might be useful for exploring dense HTML files. You can use commands
such as `BreezeNextSibling`, `BreezePrevSibling`, `BreezeFirstSibling`,
`BreezeLastSibling`, `BreezeFirstChild`, `BreezeLastChild` and `BreezeParent`.
