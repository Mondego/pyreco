Blackbox
========

This experimental publishing platform is a culmination of my passions and interests: art, persistence, simplicity, and context.

Everything I ever publish will have:

- Permanent URLs
- Query & Search
- Continual Replication

Everything is backed up and replicated. If any publishing platform shuts down, I retained every [tweet](http://archive.kennethreitz.org/42b7e752-df3e-46ae-a80e-95c2663d8895) or [photo](http://blackbox.kennethreitz.org/records/2b0ee27e-ce90-48cb-8fb8-c2cd782be990/download) I've ever published.

This is the opposite of the [410 GONE](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/10/internet-culture) situation.

Note on Licensing
-----------------

While this platform is being developed in the open, it is not open source at this time. All rights are reserved until a LICENSE file is present.

Moving Forward
--------------

This project will power the new [kennethreitz.org](http://kennethreitz.org/), which will transition to a continual thought experiment.
