Thank you for using lilac to write blog!

This is a sample post.

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
    printf("Hello world!");
    return 0;
}
```

Sample Post
-----------

A post is made up of two parts: header and body.

The header is in [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) and body is in Github Flavored Markdown,
the two parts are separated with a '---' like separator.

```
title = "Hello World"
datetime = "2013-06-05 19:38"
tags = ["sample", "some-tag"]
----------

# Here is markdown content
```

Commands
---------

To deploy a new blog in new-created directory:

    $ lilac deploy

To build site from source to htmls:

    $ lilac build

To remove all htmls lilac built:

    $ lilac clean

To start a simple HTTP server:

    $ lilac serve

To watch source changes the same time when the cute web server running:

    $ lilac serve --watch

When you save your writings, lilac can detect the changes and start rebuilding.

To run lilac's server and rebuilder in the background:

    $ lilac start

We can write blog with at most one shell session.

**NOTE: ililac was removed in version 0.3.9, use `lilac start|stop instead`**

Themes
------

You really should manage your theme in a standalone git repository, and use it as a submodule of your blog's
submodule if your blog is under git versioning too.

For instance, add theme `less` a submodule of your blog's repo:

    $ git submodule add git://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-less.git less

If you want to modify a theme created by someone else, just fork his(or her) repo, and then modify it.

But it's 100% ok to use themes not in the submodule way.
